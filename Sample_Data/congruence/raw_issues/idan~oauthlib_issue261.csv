```
curl -H ""Authorization: token 5OFlYYXeQ2nlQxocQGi4XlhINxACIr"" http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/me
```

I noted that the retrieved token results in a string without the leading character: `OFlYYXeQ2nlQxocQGi4XlhINxACIr`. I've been able to obtain the full token modifying this line in [validate_request](https://github.com/idan/oauthlib/blob/master/oauthlib/oauth2/rfc6749/tokens.py#L234) method, from

`token = request.headers.get('Authorization')[7:]`

to: `token = request.headers.get('Authorization')[6:]`

Am I doing something wrong with curl or is it something to be fixed in the library?

Only a tiny mistake in your curl, it should say ""Bearer"" where it now says ""token""

```
>>> len('Bearer')
6
>>> len('token')
5
```
