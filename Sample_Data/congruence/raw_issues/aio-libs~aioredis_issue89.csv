"issue_comment","89","aio-libs","aioredis","asvetlov","2015-10-21 08:33:13","I feel something wrong with `iget` name because the method does not the same as `get`.
Maybe `iter`?
Ideal solution would be adding `__aiter__` to `Channel` but we need to pass `encoding` and `decoder` unfortunately.

"issue_comment","89","aio-libs","aioredis","popravich","2015-10-21 08:37:12","True, it bothers me the same :/
`iter` is better but its the name of built-in function.
Anyway, if no other options appear I will rename it to `iter` later today
