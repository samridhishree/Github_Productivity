- it'd be good to add ""subject "" in front of the title [here](https://github.com/bcipolli/nilearn/blob/issue-446/examples/connectivity/plot_adhd_covariance.py#L98) because it's not clear what 0 means.
- the graph lasso doesn't have one covariance per subject so we should remove plotted_subject from the title [here](https://github.com/bcipolli/nilearn/blob/issue-446/examples/connectivity/plot_adhd_covariance.py#L103)

I must admit I don't understand the result, nor why the other graphs are identical.  Happy to email all to you, if helpful.

I would just stick to `datasets.fetch_adhd()` (i.e. 40 subjects) and remove the n_subjects line which wasn't used at all as you spotted.

Also a side-comment, this script uses n_jobs!=1 which means it won't work on Windows ...

On my machine (mac), I also have  `n_jobs` as a parameter, and set it to one.  Parallel was crashing Python for me.

I think having `n_jobs=1`, with a comment about tweaking it (including limitations), could be instructive to users.

Or, could remove `n_jobs` and have an example that focuses on the parallel (and perhaps caching) aspects of the package, as kind of a mini-tutorial.

At least, that's definitely how I'm using them :)

Will remove the second ""#"".  I converted ""Number of"" to ""#"", for space reasons, but it can just be eliminated!  Let me know if you feel strongly about the ""max"" thing, I won't push any harder than my words above :).
