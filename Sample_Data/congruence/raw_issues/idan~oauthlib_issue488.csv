"issue_comment","488","idan","oauthlib","skion","2017-10-05 15:56:32","I wonder if it is better to unlink ID Tokens from (more general) JWT tokens here...

Some providers generate ID Tokens fit for one-time validation with an expiry that cover just the login process. And such providers may want to issue JWT-structured access tokens instead. 

I'm guessing the validation semantics would be largely the same, but the naming might be confusing in this situation?

I can see this as helping the transition to supporting OIDC and it looks like a lot of work for adding non-openidconenct JWT support per #50 may be shared by this.

I will get back to openid connect next month as a professional job priority.

@duaneking This is part of a effort to add oidc support to django-oauth-toolkit [1] I'm not sure where the code necessary to create JWT should live so for now it's all on django-oauth-toolkit  side.
