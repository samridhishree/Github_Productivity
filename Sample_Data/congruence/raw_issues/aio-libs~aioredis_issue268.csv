"issue_comment","268","aio-libs","aioredis","popravich","2017-07-17 07:13:38","Hi, the one thing you can do is to wait until data loading is complete.
You can catch this particular error, and retry after some idle (sleep) time.
Also, you can use `info persistence` command and wait for `loading` flag to become `0`.
Check the command documentation (see persistence section) https://redis.io/commands/info","",""
