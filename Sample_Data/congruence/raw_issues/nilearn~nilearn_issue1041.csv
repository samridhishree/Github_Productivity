``` python
from nilearn.input_data import NiftiMasker
import nibabel
import numpy as np

masker = NiftiMasker(mask_img=nibabel.Nifti1Image(np.ones((10, 5, 5), dtype=int).astype(int), np.eye(4)))
masker.fit()
masker.transform(nibabel.Nifti1Image(np.random.random((20, 5, 5, 12)), np.eye(4))).shape
```

This works and outputs `(12,250)` but masking data with a mask having a different shape should be prohibited.

Why? What matters is that the data are in the same brain space.
