"issue_title","529","nilearn","nilearn","fnielsen","2015-03-31 19:35:49","There are problems with nilearn.datasets.fetch_harvard_oxford

Documentation indicates that a Nifti1Image object should be returned. But it is a tuple and line 1675 does return a string (the filename), e.g.:

```
 volume, labels = nilearn.datasets.fetch_harvard_oxford('sub-maxprob-thr25-2mm', symmetric_split=False)
```

A possible fix is:

```
   if not symmetric_split:
        atlas_img = check_niimg(atlas_img)
        atlas = atlas_img.get_data() 
        return new_img_like(atlas_img, atlas, atlas_img.get_affine()), names.tolist()

>>> type(labels) == list
True
```

(but it is unclear to me whether this output is the intended)

Another problem is line 1689 `for s, _, _ in slices` as elements may be None. It may be triggered with: 

```
nilearn.datasets.fetch_harvard_oxford('sub-maxprob-thr25-2mm', symmetric_split=True)
```

Fix: 

```
crosses_middle = [slice[0].start < middle_ind and slice[0].stop > middle_ind
                   for slice in slices if slice is not None]
```

This is more a problem of documentation: the function return a Niimage-like object which can be a filepath.

Good catch!

The documentation inconsistency is going to be tackled in #486 so I am going to close this issue.
