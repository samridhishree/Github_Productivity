I am puzzled that the non-zero voxels are different from in the map that were obtained by mass-univariate approach. The voxel selection here is relying on an ANOVA.

It is not as mature as the predictive modeling part. Right now nilearn is
in it's early stage, and we need to make sure that the markert most what

Technically, not a full copy is needed, but I think the engineering costs around generating a fake file (and associated catching of the specific test use-case) are greater than that of chipping the full CSV file into Nilearn.
This statement is true conditionally to the fact that several examples behave that way, otherwise the engineering costs associated with handling the current `nilearn_data/data` directory management are then greater.

Internally `ndimage.gaussian_filter` does several 1D filters. But it doesn't seem to treat degenerate cases, `sigma_i=0` in any special way. So I would refrain from using it in our case.

My bad, actually it _does_

We'll need to break examples in sub directories, to separate advanced from simple examples. However, this means that we'll have to move examples in sub-dirs, which means that we won't be able to rely on the current behavior that people download the package, don't install it, and it works. I want to do this only when we do an actual release.

But I think the overhead incurred by doing that and using `ndimage.gaussian_filter` and the overhead incurred by looping over the axes with `ndimage.gaussian_filter_1d` is about the same. The outcome is identical, since one calls the other internally. So if there is no convincing supplementary reason to change this, ntrs
