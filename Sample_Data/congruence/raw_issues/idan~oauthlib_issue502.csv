"issue_title","502","idan","oauthlib","clancychilds","2017-11-18 22:44:54","I have the case where an OIDC endpoint returns an `id_token` JWT which then needs to be passed to a /token endpoint using grant_type `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer` as the `assertion` and then receive the resource access token.
From poking around, it looks like the ServiceApplicationClient is really close to this, but doesn't take into account the possibility that the JWT is already created (as it mainly works  to create the JWT itself).
If I was to work on this, what would be better:

1. Create a new Client class (probably just extending ServiceApplicationClient) that takes a pre-configured JWT? (What should I call this class?)
2. add a `jwt` parameter to the ServiceApplicationClient which, when it exists, would use that and bypass all of the JWT creation code

Or am I completely missing a better way to do this?","start issue","Allowing for already-created JWTs to be exchanged in JWT Bearer client flow"
