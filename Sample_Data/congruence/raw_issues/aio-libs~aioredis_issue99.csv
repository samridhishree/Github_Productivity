"issue_comment","99","aio-libs","aioredis","popravich","2015-11-30 13:50:58","Anyway, why would you need a pool of reconnecting connections?
Main idea behind pool is to manage connections -- drop closed & create new.
Have you tried [reconnecting redis](http://aioredis.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api_reference.html#aioredis.create_reconnecting_redis)?

"issue_comment","99","aio-libs","aioredis","brunsgaard","2015-12-03 09:17:56","@popravich, Maybe I have misunderstood the connection pool, if a connection is closed due to network failure etc, will the current implementation of the pool then discard it and create a new one seamlessly?

"issue_comment","99","aio-libs","aioredis","popravich","2015-12-03 09:30:55","Yes, it will create new one.

Closed (disconnected) connections would not be a problem as long as connections from pool are used for short lived actions, ie:

``` python
# Bad
with (yield from redis_pool) as redis:
    # inside this block a single connection bound to redis variable
    while True:
        data = yield from wait_long_time_for_data()
        yield from redis.set(key, data)

# Good
while True:
    data = yield from wait_long_time_for_data()
    with (yield from redis_pool) as redis:
        yield from redis.set(key, data)
```
