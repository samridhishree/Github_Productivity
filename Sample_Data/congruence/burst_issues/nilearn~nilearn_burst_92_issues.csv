This is problematic because in this case an unaware user can pass an int n as the argument and run  `haxby_dataset.func[0]`, which will return data for subject 1 instead of subject n. It seems to me that we should either:
- Make this use case explicit in the docstring or;
- Throw an error when `subjects` is an int.

> We recently migrated to a new AWS account.  As part of this migration, the data from the 'fcp-indi' bucket was synced to a temporary bucket ('fcp-indi-new') belonging to our new account.  After the migration of our data to the new account, our old account was deleted, and along with it the old 'fcp-indi' bucket.  In order to preserve the S3 paths that we had been using under the old account, we re-created the 'fcp-indi' bucket under our new account and began syncing all of the data in 'fcp-indi-new' to it.  At this time, I changed the URLs in our documentation to ensure that interested researchers could still access our data from the temporary bucket while it was syncing to the new 'fcp-indi' bucket.  Presently, the file sync is finished and the only reason that the temporary bucket ('fcp-indi-new') is still referred to in the documentation is that we also had to change permissions for all the files in 'fcp-indi' using a script so that they were publicly readable.  This script has finished executing, however, and I am reverting the documentation to refer to the 'fcp-indi' bucket now.
> 
> So to answer your question, the data is the same in 'fcp-indi-new' and 'fcp-indi', but you shouldn't need to change your code.  In fact, you should use 'fcp-indi', since we are going to remove the 'fcp-indi-new' bucket now that our migration is finished.

http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.jaccard_similarity_score.html

Overall, this kind of functionality, not strictly neuroimaging related, lives more in scikit-learn than nilearn.

What may be useful could be to add a function to do matching of 2 sets of maps, using sklearn.utils.linear_assignment. It should also be added to a nilearn example, for instance at the end of http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_compare_resting_state_decomposition.html, to plot the same map for both ICA and dict-learning.

No, that's a formal problem. In what application setting? What the
'brain' question?

They need more. It's like giving people a showel when they want to build

Once again: either you can do a convincing example, or it does not go
into nilearn. Without a convincing example, it either won't be used, or
we'll keep getting questions on how to use it.

That's a clear and important rule of nilearn: anything that goes in must
produce an example that is relevant for brain imaging, even for people
who are not computer scientists.

6 subjects, and make 2 different sub-groups of 5 subjects, with only 10
components.

To make an example that is easy to follow, I think that you need
something higher level than just the Jaccard index. It's too low level,
and will lead to a lot of numpy code in the example. Maybe a function
that take 2 set of maps, returns a reordered version and a list of
similarities.

Scikit-learn implements the Jaccard Index in the specific setting of measuring clustering similarity. Here we have a fuzzy extension of the measure that will probably not be accepted in sklearn because there is no ""best"" way to make this extension. In particular, people in neuroimaging tend to use extensions that do not rely on linear assignment of the regions, see _Generalized Overlap Measures for Evaluation and
Validation in Medical Image Analysis_ (Crum 2006)

We then create atlases for both splits using CanICA and Dictionary Learning. Finally, we compute two Jaccard indexes: one between the CanICA atlases and one between the DictLearning atlases, to compare replicability between methods. The narrative would explain that we want our methods to be not only valid, but also replicable, and would give an intuitive explanation of the index.

I think it's reasonably high-level and light on numpy code (most of the example is just _getting_ the atlases, which is quite a standard analysis, and computing the jaccard indexes is done in one line).

I really like the idea of comparing two atlases map by map and trying to find a one-to-one correspondence, and I believe a lot of people would be interested in it. However, it seems to me like a significantly different question than just measuring similarity between atlases, shouldn't we leave it to another PR?
