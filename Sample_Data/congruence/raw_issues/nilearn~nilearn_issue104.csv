```
confound_file = dataset[""confounds""]
hv_confounds = nilearn.image.high_variance_confounds(filename)

masker = nilearn.input_data.NiftiLabelsMasker(
    atlas[""maps""], resampling_target=""labels"", detrend=True,
    low_pass=None, high_pass=0.01, t_r=2.5, standardize=True,
    memory=mem, memory_level=1, verbose=1)
masker.fit(filename, confounds=[hv_confounds, confound_file])
```

It could be handy to add a `high_variance_confounds` keyword to Nifti maskers, to avoid these extra lines and options. One would write instead:

```
confound_file = dataset[""confounds""]

masker = nilearn.input_data.NiftiLabelsMasker(
    atlas[""maps""], resampling_target=""labels"", 
    detrend=True, high_variance_confounds=True,
    low_pass=None, high_pass=0.01, t_r=2.5, standardize=True,
    memory=mem, memory_level=1, verbose=1)
masker.fit(filename, confounds=confound_file)
```
