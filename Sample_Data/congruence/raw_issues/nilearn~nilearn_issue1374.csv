Agreed.

> +1. We want the code to match the journal paper.

So we also have to change the journal paper?

>>This code should be moved or simply removed.
>What does it entail?

It is the code used to load MemorizedResults, ie out of core computation. I think it would be nice to have an algorithm that uses it but it should go to a utils module rather than here.

> Let's keep it for now: I suspect that we have a lot of progress to do on the stopping criterion

From my experience, the algorithm may do some unnecessary iterations at the end rather than not enough. We have indeed work to do if we want to find the best criterion.","",""
