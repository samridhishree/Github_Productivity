thank you for this great library.

I implemented the request validator as described in the documentation, but I get this exception after executing the _authenticate_client_ method:

```
Authenticate client must set the request.client.client_id attribute in authenticate_client.
```

https://github.com/idan/oauthlib/blob/master/oauthlib/oauth2/rfc6749/grant_types/authorization_code.py#L374

Is there a difference between _request.client_id_ and _request.client.client_id_? I think the line of code should be

```
if not hasattr(request, 'client_id'):
```
","start issue","Is the *request.client.client_id* attribute really necessairy?"
"issue_comment","389","idan","oauthlib","Bramas","2016-01-18 00:12:34","Hello,
I have the same error.
And I don't understand how can client_id can be an attribute of request.client if client is just a param extracted from the query string (ie, a string itself) 
So I also think this should be:

```
if not hasattr(request, 'client_id'):
```

"issue_comment","389","idan","oauthlib","Bramas","2016-01-18 11:22:00","In AuthorizationCodeGrant::validateTokenRequest, we have

``` python
        if self.request_validator.client_authentication_required(request):
            if not self.request_validator.authenticate_client(request):
                log.debug('Client authentication failed, %r.', request)
                raise errors.InvalidClientError(request=request)
        elif not self.request_validator.authenticate_client_id(request.client_id, request):

            log.debug('Client authentication failed, %r.', request)
            raise errors.InvalidClientError(request=request)

        if not hasattr(request.client, 'client_id'):
            raise NotImplementedError('Authenticate client must set the '
                                      'request.client.client_id attribute '
                                      'in authenticate_client.')
```

The error comes from the last if **but**:

In authenticate_client_id function the doc says:

```
        Note, while not strictly necessary it can often be very convenient
        to set request.client to the client object associated with the
        given client_id.
```

So actually request.client can have an attribut client_id but this **must be set in authenticate_client_id or in authenticate_client**
This should be indicated correctly in the doc! 
We should replace `while not strictly necessary` by `it is strictly necessary`
