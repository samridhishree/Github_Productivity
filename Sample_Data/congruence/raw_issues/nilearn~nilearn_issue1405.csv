"issue_comment","1405","nilearn","nilearn","arthurmensch","2017-03-04 09:34:30","I agree this is not a good design : this requires to load in memory all of the nifti images when dispatching them with joblib. But this is the only way to have consistent hashing across pickling, if we are not to modify the joblib hashing code itself (which is what I do in my code, to avoid the memory issue).","",""
