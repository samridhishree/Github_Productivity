this is a tiny branch that adds support to the client to set the ""realm"" for the authentication. I'm not sure if that the right place or if it should be a paramter of client.sign() instead (similar to the old python-oauth). Happy to change it if you prefer it differently.

Sorry for taking ages to respond, thought I did the day after you sent it but my memory obviously fails me. At a glance it looks good but would be great if you could
- add an optional realm param to sign as well, then do a realm or self.realm
- change the prepare_headers to use keywords explicitly, ie realm=
- confirm whether the realm should be included in the signature because my memory fails me here again

Cheers! Oh and add yourself to AUTHORS too =)

I'm not fully sure what you mean with the last bit, but the rfc says:
""""""
 o  The OAuth HTTP ""Authorization"" header field (Section 3.5.1) if
      present.  The header's content is parsed into a list of name/value
      pairs excluding the ""realm"" parameter if present.  The parameter
      values are decoded as defined by Section 3.5.1.
""""""
I guess this is what you meant, right?

Please let me know what you think and I'm happy to restructure/address anything, I'm new to your codebase :)

"issue_comment","60","idan","oauthlib","ib-lundgren","2012-10-30 20:02:02","Had a vague memory of that being the case, thanks for confirming. The reason I wanted it in sign as well is that you might have several realms bound to one access token and switching would be useful in some cases.

I was going to sneakily try and trick you into writing some Client tests since none has felt like doing that so far but I guess I'm too late... =) 

Please merge from master and update your tests to use from **future** import unicode_literals instead of u"""" strings. Cheers
