Good point. So what we should do would be, in map_show, to set a
threshold a bit below the minimum contour, so that the mechanism of
bounding box is reused.

I've tried something in this direction in

while listening to a talk. @fliem, can you check that it solves your

If you look at the resampled data, you have some NaNs and big values of the order of `1e308`. It seems like the culprit is that the scipy functions we are using don't deal well with big-endian dtypes on my little-endian machine.",start issue,resample_img problem with big-endian data on a little-endian machine

3,issue_comment,1445,nilearn,nilearn,lesteve,2017-05-09 11:35:51,"FYI I opened https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/7388 in the scipy tracker. The problem is very similar to the one we had 2+ years ago, except that this one happens when the affine passed into `ndimage.affine_transform` is 1d. The fix I did at the time only fixed the case where affine` is 2d :cry:",,
