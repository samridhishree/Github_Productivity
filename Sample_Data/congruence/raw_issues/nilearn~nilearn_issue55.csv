The only question is about the naming scheme: I created in the previous branch a ""image"" package, to contain functions related to niimg processing, as opposed to ""signals"" which is related to timeseries processing. 

An alternate name would be smooth_img(), but as it is already in the ""image"" namespace, it seems redundant to me.
