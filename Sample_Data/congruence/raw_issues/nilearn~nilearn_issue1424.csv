https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/nilearn/regions/region_extractor.py#L401
so the default value `smoothing_fwhm=6.` of function `connected_regions` is systematically applied and this is not suitable for my mice images (voxel size is 0.2x0.2x0.2)

Another point is that `min_region_size` is assumed to be an `int` and in my case it may be lower than 1.

The first problem yes. The second one, I don't understand.

@KamalakerDadi may be I was unclear. So first my mouse fMRI images have different range than human images, e.g.` print func_imgs[0].header.get_zooms()` gives `(0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 1.0)`. Now I am using DictionaryLearning to extract my networks, with a smoothing FWHM suitable for my data
```Python
from nilearn.decomposition import DictLearning

dict_learn = DictLearning(n_components=20, smoothing_fwhm=.3, n_jobs=-3)
dict_learn.fit(func_imgs)
components_img = dict_learn.masker_.inverse_transform(dict_learn.components_)
```
At this point everything works fine. Now I want to keep only large enough regions
```Python
extractor = RegionExtractor(components_img, thresholding_strategy='ratio_n_voxels',
    extractor='local_regions', min_region_size=.4)
extractor.fit()
```
and here I have an error
```Python
ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation maximum which has no identity
```

However when I set `smoothing_fwhm=.3` here
```Python
https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/nilearn/regions/region_extractor.py#L401
```
I get my regions extracted.","",""
