"issue_title","296","idan","oauthlib","JamSquad","2014-11-14 17:28:38","Some providers (Specifically Mailchimp) don't supply a token_type or a scope with their OAuth authentication flow.

This causes a TypeError ('NoneType' object is not iterable) when trying to init the OAuth2Token class.  (Because it is wrapped in a set()).

Possible solution is to try, except TypeError around this call in tokens.py line 30

Or possibly I'm missing something entirely.

"issue_comment","296","idan","oauthlib","mblayman","2014-12-17 04:45:28","I experiencing this too. When I look at this problem, I'm trying to figure out why `scope_to_list` is returning `None` when scope is `None`. https://github.com/idan/oauthlib/blob/master/oauthlib/oauth2/rfc6749/utils.py#L41-L42

Wouldn't it be better to return an empty list?

If a Oauth2 server doesn't return the a scope on the response, then it assumed it changed. The Oauth2 may not return a scope in the response if it didn't change which scope was requested. More info on #306 as well. 

I am not sure why but another person I know using Google + flask-oauthlib doesn't get this error but I can create it 100% of the time.

If you're stuck and don't have the luxury of waiting on a release, you can host the compliance fixes in your own code.
