This is why wanting to use more than 2 different colors with nilearn-provided colormaps may currently not be easy, at times.

Suggestion: perhaps one or two more ""standard"" colors could to added

You want also the cmy flavor corresponding to the rgb ones? Fine with me,
it's just a PR away :).

So, 1 out of 20 plot viewers/paper readers will not be able to tell red and green aspects apart. In fact, this twentieth person might be one of your reviewers ;-)

Something I would say: transparent color map rendering is not great and that's the reason we dropped them from the glass brain if you remember.

In order to show several things in the same plot, I made some code to take _n_ colors from any colormap and create a ""transparent to color"" colormap. Typically, if you apply that to 3 fuzzy brain maps with the spectral colormap, it will take the first, the last and the middle color of spectral, build 3 colormaps different from them, and overlay the 3 brain maps on one figure.

I know that it won't solve the color blindness problem, but if you think that (part of) this code can be useful here, it is just 2 clicks away ;).
