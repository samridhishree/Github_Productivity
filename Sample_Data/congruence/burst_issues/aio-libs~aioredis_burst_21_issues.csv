```python
ch1 = Channel('ch:1', loop=loop)
ch2 = Channel('ch:2', loop=loop)

```
This will allow to use custom channel classes (probable use: custom decoding, custom internal queue, etc).

To do:
* [x] Implement arguments check in `execute_pubsub`:
       allow `Channel` instances, `str` or `bytes`;
* [x] Update `_process_pubsub/_process_data` to respect Channel arguments to `execute_pubsub`;
* [ ] Either add `ABCChannel` or split `Channel`'s interface to public & private
      (to allow reimplement in subclasses);
