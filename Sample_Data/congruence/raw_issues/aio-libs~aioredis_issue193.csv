I have a question which answer I cannot find in the documentation.

I have two situations which I don't know how to handle. The first one, I would like to do something like:

```
SET resource value NX PX 10000
```

NX for the `create if not exists` and PX for the `ttl`

The most similar way to do it that I have found is (assumming that `_connect()` returns a connection pool):

```
with await self._connect() as redis:
            await redis.set(""resource"", ""value"")
            await redis.expire(""resource"", 10)
```

The problem is that I cannot say if the set has the NX option and the two operations are not atomic. Is there a way to call a raw redis command through `aioredis`? If not, how can I achieve my goal?

My second question is if there is a way to run Lua scripts with the library.

Many thanks for your help and sorry if you have the information in the documentation and I didn't find it :)","start issue","NX and PX options"

There are two ways you can run `SET key value NX PX timeout` command:
* run `set` with keyword args: 
  ```python
  await redis.set('resource', 'value', pexpire=10000, exist=redis.SET_IF_NOT_EXIST)
  ```
* or run raw command using `execute` method:
  ```python
  await redis.execute('set', 'resource', 'value', 'nx', 'px', 10000)
  ```

Here is the [Lua-scripts related docs](http://aioredis.readthedocs.io/en/v0.3.0/mixins.html#scripting-commands)

Try these and return if you have any questions)","",""

I will try it when I have time but it looks great ðŸ™‚ . Do you think that we could add the NX and PX options to the documentation for future users? I you point me where I will be happy to submit a PR.","",""
