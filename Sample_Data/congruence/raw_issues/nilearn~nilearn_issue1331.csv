Of course it is possible to use joblib but this may not be so easy or accessible for everyone and just like e.g. extracting timeseries, calculating high variance confounds can take some time.","start issue","High Variance Confounds - add memory parameter"

users.

I wonder however if it would not be good to add it, in some way, as an
option to the maskers. In such situation, it would be easy to insert
memory on it.

+1. Before reaching masker level, I think it is good start with adding in function level.","",""

Well, the thing is that at the function level it is trivial to add if you
know joblib (just use joblib on the function). As this function is for
advanced user, we should rather point them to use joblib (for instance
with a sub-section in the advanced part of the documentation).

p.s. Perhaps this issue is related to issue #104.

mem = Memory(cachedir = 'nilearn_cache')
