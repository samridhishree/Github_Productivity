Note that I have added diagnostics in 'bases.py', so the line number 261 may not be accurate:
260:  print(caller,caller.args)
this prints: CallFunc() []
before the traceback

we would need the smallest possible code snippet that reproduce the
problem. Also you may want to try pylint 1.1 (but I don't think it will fix
your pb)/
