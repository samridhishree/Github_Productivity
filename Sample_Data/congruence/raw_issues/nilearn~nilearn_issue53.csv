In that case I don't understand why the the radius parameter is expected to be float?

I would like to file a PR to clarify the docstring, but first wanted to check with you guys.

Agreed!

"issue_comment","53","nilearn","nilearn","pgervais","2013-05-16 14:58:08","I had a look at the source code. Taking into account the aspect ratio is technically not difficult. 
However, we need to have access to pixel sizes inside `SearchLight.fit()`, which is not the case right now. The fix will thus include an API change.

Two possibilities:
- The simplest way is to add an ""affine"" parameter to `SearchLight.__init__()`, and keep `mask` and `process_mask` as numpy.ndarray
- Another one would be to pass `mask` and `process_mask` as niimg.

I think the second solution is a better one, because the transformer is very specific to fMRI, and as such, should process fMRI images, not arrays.

@GaelVaroquaux, if you have some time, can you give your opinion?

I also updated the plot_haxby_searchlight.py example, so that you can figure out quickly what the changes were.
