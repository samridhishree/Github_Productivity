Sorry for late reply, I completely missed the notification for this. I fear it might be a few days before I can review it fully but will try and get to it soon.

Did you find that a lot of the code was shared between django and flask or is it a completely different beast? If much is shared we should try and find a a base class for decorators or maybe a set of utilities.

"issue_comment","148","idan","oauthlib","flippmoke","2013-05-09 21:34:48","Most of the code was very similar. If you want to have a shared way, I can help you with the flask side of it. I am in the #oauthlib chat on freenode most workdays, feel free to message me there if you want to talk.

I do have some concerns on how flask deals with session data by default. When using this code myself, I make sure to change how flask deals with its default session. Most of the changes between django and flask are simply that flask has a global request object you import while django passes it around.

Just FYI I'm travelling around Italy the entire week but will get to this early next week.

"issue_comment","148","idan","oauthlib","ib-lundgren","2013-05-20 10:11:47","@flippmoke it seems you are only using the decorator/previously g object to provide certain key:values to the protected resource view. Am I missing something or would it not be easier to just update the kwargs passed into the view similarly to what the django decorator is doing?

If we worry about overriding kwargs we could prefix the keywords but doubt it will be a common issue.

Will try and implement a basic provider with your decorator later today =)

Instead, it is better to use the [request context](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/extensiondev/#the-extension-code) directly and provide properties by other proxy object, or `OAuth2ProviderDecorator` itself. Making it to the Flask extension might be helpful.
