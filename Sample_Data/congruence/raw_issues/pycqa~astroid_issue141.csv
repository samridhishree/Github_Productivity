Given the following code, trying to understand `self._content += 'c'` will result in an BinaryOperationError, because astroid will consider the very first value of self._content, even though it was reassigned later on. We should have some sort of evaluation that will know not to retrieve these kind of values.

```
#!python

  self._content = None
   ...
   ...
   self._content = ""ceva""
   self._content += ""c
```
