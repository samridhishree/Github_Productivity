it seems that we are running the unit tests on circleCI. I think that we should skip them: they are already ran on travis, and I would really like the circleCI total time to be smaller.

CircleCI has much more horse power, both in terms of storage and length
of the runs. We use it to generate/test docs. Travis is for unit testing.

This is irrelevant, I believe: the estimate is based only on the past
runs.

I guess. I don't know. I didn't have time to look at this so far.
