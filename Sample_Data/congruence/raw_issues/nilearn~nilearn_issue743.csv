One reason to love Codacy even if you have no clue what it does: it rates nilearn as an A project: https://www.codacy.com/app/lesteve/nilearn/dashboard.

I seem to remember that we checked the error message to make sure it mentioned 4d rather than 3d or something like that.

We check that the number of dimensions asked is the right one ""Data must be 4D but you provided"" but we don't check the number of dimensions given by the user.
