- do an explicit copy at the beginning of the function, and the rest inplace
- do everything inplace and make an explicit copy above

For the moment, there is a bug since the code expects _standardize to do a copy of signals and the copy is not done if no treratment is requested.

"pull_request_commit_comment","580","nilearn","nilearn","eickenberg","2015-05-11 13:10:59","that part is fine: What we want is the projector `confounds.dot(np.linalg.pinv(confounds)).dot(signals)`, which is `confounds.dot(pinv(confounds.T.dot(confounds))).dot(confounds.T).dot(signals)`, which amounts to what is written, because `confounds = Q.dot(R)` and `confounds.T.dot(confounds) = R.T.dot(Q.T).dot(Q).dot(R)` and `Q` disappears because it is orthogonal.

But as mentioned in an outside comment, this would have been handled by `confounds.dot(pinv(confounds).dot(signal))` also. The only question is where `pinv` cuts off singular values. AFAIK this is at `1e-15`.

focus on the big picture: the problem is solved, and we want to release
0.1.3 to get bug fixes out to our users.

You may perfectly be right. I would welcome a PR with corresponding
timings showing that it is possible to simplify the code with the same
numerical stability and speed. But in the mean time, I really want to get
0.1.3 out.

My comments are entirely for future readability reasons, and this only speaking for my `pinv`-biased point of view, so they probably don't even generalize to other people.

+1 from my side for merging this.
