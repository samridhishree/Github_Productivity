"issue_title","121","idan","oauthlib","elachuni","2013-02-21 19:34:10","When signing an OAuth1 request with Content-Type 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' and a body, the header needs to be exactly ""Content-Type"".

The check oauthlib performs is case-sensitive, so neither ""Content-type"" nor ""content-type"" work and oauthlib will raise ValueError(""Body contains parameters but Content-Type header was not set."") as if there weren't a content-type header at all.
