For exemple, several VBM images makes a 4D image: should it be processed by NiftiMasker or MultiNiftiMasker?

This issue is not only about code but about package organization and doc. For exemple, a `mask_strategy='vbm'` may be meaningful for the user, even it falls back on the `background` strategy.

I tag it as a discussion because it is more of something to keep in mind rather than a precise problem to solve.
