I used the `plotting.plot_connectome` function with `black_bg=True`, but when figure is displayed I could not see the brain contour. I use matplotlib 1.5 github version.
After digging out in the nilearn code I found that in the `glass_brain.py` file the first line of code
`black_bg = ax.get_axis_bgcolor() == 'k'","start issue","Issue with matplotlib dev version and plot_brain_schematics"

"issue_comment","1094","nilearn","nilearn","rschmaelzle","2016-05-10 23:03:56","sounds related to an issue I just ran into, but I'm not sure:
in plotting.plot_connectome, the alpha argument that is supposed to set the transparency of the brain schematics has no effect on my machine (matplotlib 1.5.0) - i.e. whether I give 0.01 or 0.99 - all looks the same.
Best, Ralf
