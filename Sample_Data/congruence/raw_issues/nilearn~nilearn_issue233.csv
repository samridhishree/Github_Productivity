We should use a cheap smoothing function, not ndimage.gaussian_filter, which is too expensive, but something like:

<pre>
        X_smooth = X.copy()
        X_smooth[:-1] += .2 * X[1:]
        X_smooth[1:]  += .2 * X[:-1]
        X_smooth[:, :-1] += .2 * X[:, 1:]
        X_smooth[:, 1:]  += .2 * X[:, :-1]
        X_smooth[:, :, :-1] += .2 * X[:, :, 1:]
        X_smooth[:, :, 1:]  += .2 * X[:, :, :-1]
</pre>
