This change allowed to ensure that the `radius` parameter is in millimeter, not in voxel size, **and** that non-isotropic voxels are correctly handled.

This should close issue #53.

I removed two lines whose usefulness is doubtful to me (to say the least) (lines 145-146). If someone has an idea, I'd appreciate it. Removing them removed artifacts that occured in plot_simulated_data.py. 

After fixing plot_simulated_data.py, the result of searchlight seems to be reasonable. It is not just noise as before.
Good to merge for me.
