I think ""GenericEndpoint"" is a bit too vague, maybe call it ""SignatureOnlyEndpoint"" or something similar?

While not a bad idea for this type of endpoint it is slightly more than just checking the signature. Was this what you intended? If so I'm happy to merge.

The operations seems common enough, even for a 0-legged case, that I think that it would be strange if it were not checked the same way as for the other endpoints that use the client key.
