It would be really awesome to have a test that could be used against OAuthLibs verify_request to ensure it does not introduce variance in execution time between different requests in a way that would allow user enumeration or secret key guessing. 

A large bonus if this could easily be imported by developers implementing oauth providers and ran against their setup.
