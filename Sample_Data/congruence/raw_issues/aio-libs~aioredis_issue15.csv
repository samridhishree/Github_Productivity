"issue_comment","15","aio-libs","aioredis","popravich","2014-06-20 07:42:14","Ok, I've looked throught and here is my thoughts.
I'am not really happy with `encoder=...` parameter:
- first of all its name -- its purpose to decode reponse but it named 'encoder' -- this is confusing.
- second (and major reason why I discorage this) -- I think decoding Redis responses is up to
  end-user of the library.

I aggree that working with raw bytes is not a very good idea, so here is the ticket for thinking on how to deal with it #16.

"issue_comment","15","aio-libs","aioredis","jettify","2014-06-20 18:04:23","You are right, my bad.
- ^encoder^ removed
- until #16 is not resolved, I assume that everything is bytes, and end user is responsible for decoding
