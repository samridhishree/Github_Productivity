Wouldn't it be interesting to explicitly integrate it into `nilearn.image` ?

I could use it on dict learning vs canica example (PR #638); Right now I use sklearn code in the middle of the script, which makes it too difficult for the non expert neuroscientist.

I believe only a handful of methods geeks. When performed across methods,
this is really something that only methods researchers would do. Across
subjects, it's really something that shouldn't be done.

The framework that we are trying to push to compare subjects with
functional connectivity is to use decomposition methods to learn regions,
and then to use a connectome comparison method on the corresponding set
of regions.

Maybe we should have a public one?

Chances are that it would be a mess. I don't see why it would be more
successful that Parietal-Python. But it would also be accessible to
external researchers, which is a good thing.
