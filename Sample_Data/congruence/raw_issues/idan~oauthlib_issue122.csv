"issue_title","122","idan","oauthlib","elachuni","2013-02-21 19:40:08","Using OAuth1, if you attempt to sign a request with an empty body and a Content-Type header 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded', oauthlib will think that there was actually a body but that it wasn't able to decode it, and raise ValueError(""Headers indicate a formencoded body but body was not decodable."")

Admittedly it's not all that usual to submit an empty body with a Content-Type header, but the calling code shouldn't need to special case this out and remove the Content-Type header or set it to something else (specially as some servers might then refuse this request without even looking to see if the body is empty).

Right there in Client.sign, oauthlib should be able to tell the difference between ""there was no body"" and ""there was a body but I was unable to decode it"".

Thanks!
