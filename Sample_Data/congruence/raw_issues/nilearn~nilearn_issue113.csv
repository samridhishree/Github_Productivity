with him and explain the usecase and show the codebase.

I have a branch with that work but I think I never made the PR because it is intricated with another modification (shelving). I am rebasing it right now, it shouldn't be too much work to remove shelving and keep only the parallel part.

I can do the PR in the early afternoon or you can use my ""parallel_multi"" branch (you must have a joblib version that support shelving, or comment the MemorizedResult import).
