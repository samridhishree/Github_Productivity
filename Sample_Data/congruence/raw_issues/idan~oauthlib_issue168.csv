If you want to earn eternal fame and glory any help looking into
- Module descriptions, i.e. what the current file / package does
- Escalating file size, a file spanning hundreds of lines should likely be broken apart into several sub modules.
- Method documentation should include parameter descriptions and a short overview of what its purpose is. Interactive style examples are great to have as well.
- Documentation is rendered with Sphinx and can utilize a range of nice mark up features which can be used to make it easier to digest, i.e. code block highlighting and cross referencing.
- Any PEP8 violations.
- Lack of code coverage
- Lack of edge case tests exercising input sizes and encodings
- Messy imports. Should preferably be uniform and ordered alphabetically.
- Widespead py 2/3 compatability clauses that should be moved into a new oauthlib.compat
- And anything else you can think of to improve code and docs health

will be greatly appreciated =)

I think you meant lines with over 80 characters, and yes if you fancy splitting them that would be awesome.

Feel free to use whatever linter you prefer, not tried flake8 myself yet.

You can easily raise the limit to 120 chars adding a `.pep8` config to your project.

```
[pep8]
max-line-length = 120

This is serious stuff! :+1:

For example, its common to run a python linter tool such as flake8; Maybe that should be the official standard for the project?","",""
