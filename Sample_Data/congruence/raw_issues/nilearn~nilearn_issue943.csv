Neurovault has mixed 3D and 4D images. I decimate each image into 3D by calling `iter_img`: 
https://github.com/bcipolli/nilearn/commit/82dc576903441a60cdfdd37609ca585ee57f3d11#diff-f88135c18752640fe6895cbceaa3ea4cR106

That code required an `if` statement decide whether to iterate or append the image, as `iter_img` fails on a 3D image. I couldn't figure out why the error is raised. I believe that neurovault is the first dataset with mixed 3D/4D images, so I conjectured that it's just because it wasn't necessary before.

So, to simplify the example, I changed the behavior to return an iterator (with one 3D image in it), rather than show an error.

"issue_comment","943","nilearn","nilearn","AlexandreAbraham","2016-01-13 14:07:27","In the codebase, `iter_img` is only used one in the code (for plotting) and in tests and examples. Personally, I am opposed to this change for the sake of consistency: iterator in Python do not iter on single elements. However, I am neutral regarding the addition of a parameter in iter_img to accept single elements.
