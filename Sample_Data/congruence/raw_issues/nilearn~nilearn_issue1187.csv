from nilearn import datasets, plotting
icbm152 = datasets.fetch_icbm152_2009()
plotting.plot_img(icbm152.gm)
```

gives me the following image
![icbm152_gm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7080143/17331821/daeadb10-58cc-11e6-8110-cde4ccd95236.png)

I also failed in displaying the image with `plotting.plot_anat`. Am I doing something wrong ?

For your record, plot_prob_atlas is broken particularly with icbm templates.

``` python

from nilearn import plotting

icbm = datasets.fetch_icbm152_2009()

On the other side, if I plot as it is w/o reorder_img. I see variations deep inside the code. It breaks at line 171 in displays.py
_Breaking is due to this: `y_map` has more length calculated 250 which is more than actual data length 233 in 'y' direction._
What's going wrong here ? How does `self.coord` is given ?

Some information related to that:

``` python
self.coord = 116.5 (may be half of affine in 'y' direction)
data.shape
(197, 233, 189)
 affine
array([[   1.,    0.,    0.,  -98.],
       [   0.,    1.,    0., -134.],
       [   0.,    0.,    1.,  -72.],
       [   0.,    0.,    0.,    1.]])
