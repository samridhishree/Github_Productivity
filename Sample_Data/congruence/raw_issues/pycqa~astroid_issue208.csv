The 'py' heading is superfluous for all of these files.  'py2' is superfluous for any that work on both 2 and 3, which given they're all tested under both, is all of them.  It's particularly misleading for py2stdlib.py, which covers stdlib packages from both 2 and 3.  The docstring for py2stdlib.py is wrong, since it helps with understanding several packages outside hashlib.
