Dropped usage of np.concatenate(), reducing memory usage by a factor
of 3. A test for inconsistent shapes has been added, with a clear user
error message.

Execution time of concat_niimgs() is similar, possibly slightly
shorter than for the previous version.","8ee38f02bde6038bfc9f92c9e1f8522528e1822e",""
