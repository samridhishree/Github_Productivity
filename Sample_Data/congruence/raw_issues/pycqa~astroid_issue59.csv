Due to how we visit bin ops (recursively), if the following string is large enough, it will crash Pylint with a maximum recursion depth exceeded.

```
#!python


def formatsDiagram():
    img = PhotoImage(format='gif',data=
        'R0lGODlhigJnAef/AAABAAEEAAkCAAMGAg0GBAYJBQoMCBMODQ4QDRITEBkS'

Add the ability to optimize small ast subtrees.

The first use of the AST peephole optimizer is the optimization of multiple
BinOp nodes. This removes recursivity in the rebuilder when dealing
with a lot of small strings joined by the
 addition operator. which are
now precomputed to the final string. Closes issue #59.
