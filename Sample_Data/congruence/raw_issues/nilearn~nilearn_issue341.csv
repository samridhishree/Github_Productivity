http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/connectivity/plot_ica_resting_state.html

People that want to run ICA using nilearn sometimes use it after googling. It is an example that was built to demonstrate pipelining with nilearn and scikit-learn, but it is certainly not a good ICA pipeline for fMRI. CanICA includes many small tricks that improve a lot model estimation.

We should probably move it to the advanced example section, and maybe replace ICA by something else, for which we have not integrated model.
