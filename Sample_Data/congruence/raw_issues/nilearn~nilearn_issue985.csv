What do other guys think?

The memory profiling test function is not very stable. I'll enter an issue for this.

Yes that is definitely an option. But, when negative levels are passed which means user knows exactly what he is doing. Otherwise, we warn or document separately about this keyword argument.

Well, I'm not sure about that.

This argument should have a doc anyway. But since we use a heuristic to autocomplete the input, we can decide which behavior we want.

I think, I'd rather have levels=[a] to implictly [a +\infty], without
