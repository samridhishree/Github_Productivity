But it cannot be between 0 and 1. The maps are not bound between zero and
one.

similar. Right now the end user has probably no clue on why he should set

It has some relevant information about how to clone the nilearn repo on your local computer, run the tests, open a PR (Pull Request), etc ...

The basics is to try to understand the issue and open a PR with a tentative fix/solution which we can then discuss.
