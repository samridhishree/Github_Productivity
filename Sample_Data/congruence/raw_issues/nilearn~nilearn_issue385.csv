Example (`decomposition/multi_pca.py`):

``` python
           data, variance, _ = cache(randomized_svd,
                                memory=self.memory,
                                ref_memory_level=3,
                                memory_level=self.memory_level)(
                        data.T, n_components=self.n_components)
```

Here, the caching level of the function is given as `ref_memory_level`.
Now in `input_data/base_masker.py`:

``` python
        imgs = cache(image.resample_img, memory, ref_memory_level,
                    memory_level=2, ignore=['copy'])(
                        imgs,
                        target_affine=mask_img_.get_affine(),
                        target_shape=mask_img_.shape,
                        copy=copy)
```

The caching level is now given in `memory_level`.

It also took me time to figure out that the default value given to `ref_memory_level` and `memory_level` were put so that calling the function without specifying these parameters enables caching.

See #386 for proposition to solve this issue.
