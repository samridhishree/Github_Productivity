There are two solution for this problem:
- NiftiMultiMasker.fit() could resample the data. This would be computationnaly expensive but there is a high probability that these data will be passed to transform after that.
- compute_multi_epi_mask could compute the mean epis, then resample them (which is not costly) and then compute the group mask.

I think the second solution is the best even if it implies adding options to compute_multi_epi_mask.

What do you think ?

Sounds good to me.
