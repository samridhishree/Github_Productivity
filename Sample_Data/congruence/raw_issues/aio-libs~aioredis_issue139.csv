Would it make sense to do this inside the `hmset_dict`? I could try to provide a pull request in case it's something that makes sense to support.

"issue_comment","139","aio-libs","aioredis","asvetlov","2016-09-13 19:27:48","I believe it's done for good reason.
We have the same behavior for aiohttp multidict support.
[yarl](http://yarl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) accepts `str` only in `with_query` parameter.

The problem is: until we don't have a way to return back `bool`, `int`, `float` and `datetime` back by _getter_ conversion of these values by _setter_ makes a mess I believe.

"issue_comment","139","aio-libs","aioredis","argaen","2016-09-14 08:13:00","Yeah, when I was talking about the pull request I meant both things. If you serialize something to be stored in Redis, when you retrieve it it should be exactly the same. So in this case, both the getter and setter should be modified in order to support the `True`/`False` values.

This only raises one issue which is what would we do if the user wants to store a ""True"" with pure string and retrieve it as a string? this functionality would be lost because the getter would transform it to boolean.

"issue_comment","139","aio-libs","aioredis","argaen","2016-09-19 08:32:06","Yeah that's True. I have different feelings about this. On one hand is what you say that there are many ""what ifs"" cases but on the other hand, the developer would also expect that default python types are correctly stored. If not, a sentence mentioning that because of Redis, data sent to the set functions can only be strings or ints would help :).
