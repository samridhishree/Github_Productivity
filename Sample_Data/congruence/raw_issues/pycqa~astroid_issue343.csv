Currently [AllMyChanges.com](https://allmychanges.com/p/python/astroid/) is set to track the changelog, which causes it to think that 1.4.1 is the latest release. If you wish to drop the changelog, I can reconfigure it to track PyPI instead.

The changelogs from the minor releases have their Changelog properly updated. My plan is to write some day a script for automatically update the change log across the branches, but I didn't have time for this just yet.

I'm sorry, but the changelog is not going anywhere.
