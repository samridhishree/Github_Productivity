There's a new version of [pytest-xdist](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-xdist) available.
You are currently using **1.18.1**. I have updated it to **1.19.0**

### Changelog
> 
>### 1.19.0

>================================

>Deprecations and Removals
>-------------------------

>- ``--boxed`` functionality has been moved to a separate plugin, `pytest-forked
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-forked&gt;`_. This release now depends on
>  `` pytest-forked`` and provides ``--boxed`` as a backward compatibility
>  option. (`1 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/1&gt;`_)


>Features
>--------

>- New ``--dist=loadscope`` option: sends group of related tests to the same
>  worker. Tests are grouped by module for test functions and by class for test
>  methods. See ``README.rst`` for more information. (`191 &lt;https://github.com
>  /pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/191&gt;`_)

>- Warnings are now properly transferred from workers to the master node. (`92
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/92&gt;`_)


>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Fix serialization of native tracebacks (``--tb=native``). (`196
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/196&gt;`_)




>### 1.18.2

>================================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Removal of unnecessary dependency on incorrect version of py. (`105
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/105&gt;`_)

>- Fix bug in internal event-loop error handler in the master node. This bug
>  would shadow the original errors making extremely hard/impossible for users
>  to diagnose the problem properly. (`175 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest-xdist/issues/175&gt;`_)
