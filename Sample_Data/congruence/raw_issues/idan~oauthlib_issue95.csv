"issue_title","95","idan","oauthlib","ib-lundgren","2013-01-15 20:38:08","There are two main issues with OAuth 1 provider as it stands today
- there is some testing but much can be improved
- verify_request is overly complex and should be split up

I'd like to see the second one addressed by instead using
- verify_request_token_request
- verify_access_token_request
- verify_resource_request (not yet stubbed)
  and have whatever functionality they share in verify_request refactored into private methods. 

Additionally I'd like to move to inheritance by composition and move request validation (basically all abstract methods) to a request validator object. Similar to what I've begun doing with the w.i.p. oauth 2 server. 

Currently the testing ultimately boils down to checking for ValueErrors or false which makes it easy to introduce subtle errors such as #94. I propose that in addition to this (with a request validator as mentioned above) use mock objects to assert that the False/ValueError is caused the way the test intended it to, i.e. missing parameter or invalid credentials etc.

I'm planning on implementing this when I find a free afternoon which may or may not be soon. If you are interested in giving it a go, please drop me a line =)

However to not aggravate too many off I'll try and phase it out over the span of 0.4 and remove the old style in 0.5.
