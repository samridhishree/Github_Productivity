I got many times trapped in signals extracted from unregistered atlas and functional volumes. Is there a reason why the default resampling strategy in the `NiftiLabelsMasker` is not `None` ?

I am afraid of breaking this type of scenarii to accomodate the case that the two images may not have been properly registered. Should a warning be issued for the user ?","",""
"issue_comment","1519","nilearn","nilearn","salma1601","2017-10-24 13:50:44","It's for basic use. For mice data there is not yet a standard space (analog to MNI) to which people put their data. Many times I didn't pay attention to the space to which functional volumes were registered
and use an atlas/functional data from different spaces. But the masker resamples by default so I discovered very late in the analysis my registration problem.
``` Python
from nilearn.input_data import NiftiLabelsMasker
gm_masker = NiftiLabelsMasker(labels_img=atlas_filename,
                              mask_img=non_noise_mask_img,
                              detrend=True,
                              smoothing_fwhm=.6,
                              memory='nilearn_cache')
```
Having the masker's default behavior to not resample seems less dangerous to me, no ?

Yes but I wanted to understand the reason why the default strategy is to resample

Yes you are right, this is possible but unlikely, usually unregistered images have different affines/shapes","",""

"issue_comment","1519","nilearn","nilearn","salma1601","2017-10-26 15:24:30","Yes so the logic is that if the affines are different, resampling solves the problem ? It does not solve it if the functional volumes and the atlas are not in the same space, I mean for instance functional volumes are not normalized to MNI while atlas is in MNI, no?","",""
"issue_comment","1519","nilearn","nilearn","salma1601","2017-10-26 15:32:46","Well I would think that if there is such a problem, I get an error. I understand that in plotting we resample images because the user may want to see the brains ""however"" they are. But I don't understand that the resampling is done almost ""silently"" in a preprocessing dedicated to extract time series. The most expected default behaviour for me would be not to resample, unless the user specifies he wants to do so, in which case I assume he knows what he is doing. What do you think ? ","",""
"issue_comment","1519","nilearn","nilearn","salma1601","2017-10-26 16:07:05","> most use cases your assumption will not happen

Yes in the very standard and basic use case, say atlas in MNI and all volumes normalized to MNI, my assumptions will not happen and it is convenient to have the resampling done if needed. But many other use cases exist. For mice there isn't a unique popular standard space. Also for human imagine you want to extract time series in the subjects-spaces with atlas that have been transformed in these spaces, then any little mix in the files etc will just not be noticed.

Also, many people do (or not) their resampling at the end of their spatial normalization pipeline and would not expect a timeseries extraction step to impact the resampling so they can miss such an error.

Well, even in this case setting the default to None doesn't look bad for me. The user will bump into this the very first time, and then set explicitly `resampling_target='data'`. Why want the code to run with a user unaware of this necessary step ?","",""

Why not put ```resampling_strategy=None``` manually by yourself ?

I am asking because it we change to not resample by default. Then, we may also see same situation as yours i.e. trapped in signals extracted from unregistered atlas and functional volumes. Am I wrong ?","",""

Resampling is done only when provided images have no same FOV. I think in a way it is right because most use cases your assumption will not happen.
