It seems to include ALL downloaded bytes, not just the ones downloaded in the current session, and so thinks it was REALLY FAST to get the previously downloaded chunk.

**Steps to reproduce:**

```
Nautilus:examples bcipolli$ python plot_nifti_simple.py 
Dowloading data from http://www.nitrc.org/frs/download.php/1071/NYU_TRT_session1a.tar.gz ...
Downloaded 265007637 of 697388519 bytes (38.0%, 14.1min remaining)  
```

CTRL-C to stop, then restart:

```
Nautilus:examples bcipolli$ python plot_nifti_simple.py 
Dowloading data from http://www.nitrc.org/frs/download.php/1071/NYU_TRT_session1a.tar.gz ...
Downloaded 268754944 of 697388519 bytes (38.54%,   13.1s remaining)

> parameters total_size and t0 are said to be optional, but they don't have default args.

As said above in a comment, I took this code somewhere and adapted it for our usage. I removed a lot of unused code and forgot to update the dosctring. We don't need to make these parameters optionals.

Feel free to refactor this code.

"issue_comment","350","nilearn","nilearn","bcipolli","2015-01-15 16:36:57","I am using this, so happy to make a simple fix.  I noticed that there are a few small issues in `nilearn/datasets.py:_chunk_report':
https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/nilearn/datasets.py#L89
- parameters `total_size` and `t0` are said to be optional, but they don't have default args.
- No default `t0` is actually suggested, and passing any non-meaningful value will output a non-meaninful remaining time.
- If `total_size=None` is passed, the `stderr.write` has no trailing whitespace.

It seems best to me to eliminate the idea that these args can be optional.  The codepath isn't used (and therefore not tested) anyway.

Alternately, I could implement things to make those _actually_ optional arguments, and add code for when `t0` is not specified (but `total_size` is).
