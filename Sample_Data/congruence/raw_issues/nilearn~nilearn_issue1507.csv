Not sure if this is related to #1169

Have you tried through NeuroDebian ?

@bthirion: no, I made a new virtenv and installed with pip. Haven't tried anything else yet","",""
"issue_comment","1507","nilearn","nilearn","lesteve","2017-09-28 06:44:02","I think this is partly for historical reasons, that installing numpy, scipy, scikit-learn would download the source and compile (with potentially very user unfriendly compilation errors, think Windows for example, or non optimal linear algebra) which is rarely what you wanted, hence the intructions mentioning first install dependencies then `pip install nilearn`.

With wheels you could argue that the situation changed somewhat but for example scikit-learn does not require numpy or scipy at the time of writing so you would be back to a similar problem.

As far as I know, I don't think we are planning to move away from this model in the near future. I am going to close this one.","",""

As per installation instructions in [here](http://nilearn.github.io/introduction.html#installing-nilearn), it says to first install dependencies.","",""
