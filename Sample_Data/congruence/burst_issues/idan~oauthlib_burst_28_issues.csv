I think having docs for how to keep using PyCrypto would be a good start for sure. Also, this update should make it easier for Windows users to get started using RSA-SHA1 as PyCrypto is fairly cumbersome to install there from what I gather.

Sorry for taking so long to reply. Would you like some help with something in particular or happy to tackle both implementation and docs?

Could do, though as you mentioned earlier that would break backward-compatibility.

I don't think a `warnings.warn()` is sufficient. The purpose here is to signal to the application that scope has changed, so the application can respond accordingly (by reasking for the denied permission, or downgrading the experience, or ...). The more I think about it, the more it seems like making this a per-call configuration is better than an envvar. I can easily imagine an application that wants to ignore scope changes in some contexts but not in others. The onus is then on #268 as to why an envvar is appropriate there instead of yet another parameter.

I'm skeptical that this needs to be a per-call configuration: if the application wants to ignore scope changes in some contexts but not others, the application can easily enable this exception (or whatever solution we end up with), and just take action when necessary:

``` python
try:
    parse_token_response(token_response)

So if I understand this right the problem is that since raising a Warning interrupts the flow the token is never returned. On top of my head there are a few approaches here
1. Not raising but merely logging/warning. This is awkward to ""catch"".
2. Transporting the token on the warning itself. This assumes no other modification/checking is done and complicates the logical flow.
3. Returning the warning/differing scope/etc a long with the token. Breaks current API.
4. Adding more parameters to the token like (oauthlib_)scope_changed (boolean) and (oauthlib_)old_scope. No change in flow and user would check the token items rather than catching a warning.
5. Similar to 4 but rather create a Token class (extending dict) which could have properties such as scope_changed.
6. Introduce a signalling system. Think this is a bit overkill here but maybe worth it in the long run, will have to look into signals and how they might fit a bit more.

I'm currently leaning towards 5. Thoughts?
