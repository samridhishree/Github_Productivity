It would be useful to incorporate extraction strategies when using NiftiMaskers function (like NiftiMapsMasker). Right now it seems to compute the mean signal of every regions, but for some applications, I would need the max, min, non-zero mean, std, sum, etc. Or is there already a way to accomplish this?

Good job to the developers BTW!","start issue","NiftiMapsMasker function should have an extraction strategy parameter"

Edit: I still think such a functionality would be useful (inspired from AFNI's 3dBrickStat). It would add more flexibility to maskers functions for cases where the 4D data are not fMRI but a group-based 3D structural data, per exemple. ","",""
