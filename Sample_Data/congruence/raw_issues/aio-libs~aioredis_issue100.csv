Example:

```
await redis.blpop('non existent list', 10)
```

What should be done:
Coroutine should be unblocked after 10 seconds if list is empty or does not exists.

What really happens:
Coroutine continues to wait for list creation or first element.

"issue_comment","100","aio-libs","aioredis","popravich","2015-12-06 11:39:43","Please read docs carefully, the `timeout` parameter is keyword only, so the call must look like this:

``` python
await redis.blpop('non existent list', timeout=10)
```

in your case you wait for two lists: `non existent list` and `10`
