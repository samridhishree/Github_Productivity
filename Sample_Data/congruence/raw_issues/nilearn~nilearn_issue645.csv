"issue_comment","645","nilearn","nilearn","lesteve","2015-07-17 10:42:20","The example doesn't work for me because power_coords is an array with a dtype=[('x', '<i8'), ('y', '<i8'), ('z', '<i8')] and shape (264,).

The definition for power_coords needs to be amended:

``` python
power_coords = power.rois[['x', 'y', 'z']]
```

I believe you need to use a vstack as in examples/connectivity/plot_probabilistic_atlas_extraction.py

whats more pythonic ?
