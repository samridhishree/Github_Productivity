z3c packages use a variation of

```
#!python

try:
    # Declare this a namespace package if pkg_resources is available.
    import pkg_resources
    pkg_resources.declare_namespace('z3c')
except ImportError:
    pass

```

zope packages use

```
#!python

# this is a namespace package
try:
    import pkg_resources
    pkg_resources.declare_namespace(__name__)
except ImportError:
    import pkgutil
    __path__ = pkgutil.extend_path(__path__, __name__)
```

astroid has a workaround that checks for `pkgutil.extend_path` but not for `pkg_resources.declare_namespace` (in modutils.py def _module_file).
That's why z3c packages are import-error despite being on PYTHONPATH

Any chance to get `pkg_resources.declare_namespace` checking?

We do have a fix for declare_namespace (https://bitbucket.org/logilab/astroid/src/220d7a368bcf4fb12deffa07acd309135aa724bd/astroid/modutils.py?at=default&fileviewer=file-view-default#modutils.py-686), but we need to figure out why it's not caught.

Ah, it's declare_namespace(`__name__`).

So when we can expect this (the fix mentioned above) to be released? I have `astroid==1.3.8` and it doesn't have the code.

This particular issue has no fix, I didn't have time to work on it. The one where support for declare_name(`__name__`) was added will be released shortly with pylint 1.5.0 / astroid 1.4.0. When exactly, I don't know. I'm going to start cherry-picking changes from default to 1.4.0 this week, but I have no idea when it will be finished.

Great, so I will be waiting for `pylint 1.5.0` / `astroid 1.4.0` release - thanks!

P.S.: I was talking about fix for `declare_namespace(__name__)`
