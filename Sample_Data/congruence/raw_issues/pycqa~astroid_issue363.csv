    if node in values:
TypeError: argument of type 'Uninferable' is not iterable

The problem appears to be `AstroidBuilder.delayed_asattr` not checking if `node._proxied` is Uninferable. 
I can submit this as a pull request if you would like, but I thought I would submit an issue first, as this is just some cargo cult debugging.

Let me know if there is anything else I can do.
