Both python-redis and asyncio_redis return tuples which I think is much more sensible for a high-level API.

Current: `['a', 1, 'b', 2]`
Expected: `[('a', 1), ('b', 2)]`

Would a patch to rationalize this behavior be accepted? If it was a conscious design choice, one has to ask: why?

The proposal is more or less along these lines:
```patch
 def pairs_int_or_float(value):
     it = iter(value)
-    return list(sum(([val, int_or_float(score)] for val, score in zip(it, it)),
-                    []))
+    return [(val, int_or_float(score)) for val, score in zip(it, it)]

The patch would be appreciated, ofcourse with tests and documented notes on breaking changes.","",""
