I would suggest the following semantics:

<pre>
def index_img(niimgs, index):
     niimgs = niimgs.check_niimgs(niimgs)
     return nibabel.Nifti1Image(niimgs.get_data()[:, :, :, index], niimgs.get_affine(), header=niimgs.get_header())

def iter_img(niimgs):
     niimgs = niimgs.check_niimgs(niimgs)
     for i in range(_utils.get_shape(niimgs)[3]):
         yield nibabel.Nifti1Image(niimgs.get_data()[:, :, :, i], niimgs.get_affine(), header=niimgs.get_header())
</pre>


What do people think?

I am thinking that this may be something that we should prioritize before the 1.0 release.
