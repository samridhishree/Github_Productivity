>Features added
>--------------



>### 1.6b3


>* 3588: No compact (p tag) html output in the i18n document build even when
>  :confval:`html_compact_lists` is True.
>* The ``make latexpdf`` from 1.6b1 (for GNU/Linux and Mac OS, using
>  ``latexmk``) aborted earlier in case of LaTeX errors than was the case with
>  1.5 series, due to hard-coded usage of ``--halt-on-error`` option. (refs 3695)

>* 3633: misdetect unreferenced citations



>### 1.6b2


>* 3662: ``builder.css_files`` is deprecated.  Please use ``add_stylesheet()``
>  API instead.



>### 1.6b1


>* ``sphinx.util.compat.Directive`` class is now deprecated. Please use
>  ``docutils.parsers.rst.Directive`` instead.
>* ``sphinx.util.compat.docutils_version`` is now deprecated
>* 2367: ``Sphinx.warn()``, ``Sphinx.info()`` and other logging methods are now
>  deprecated.  Please use ``sphinx.util.logging`` (:ref:`logging-api`) instead.
>* 3318: ``notice`` is now deprecated as LaTeX environment name and will be
>  removed at Sphinx 1.7. Extension authors please use ``sphinxadmonition``
>  instead (as Sphinx does since 1.5.)
>* ``Sphinx.status_iterator()`` and ``Sphinx.old_status_iterator()`` is now
>  deprecated.  Please use ``sphinx.util:status_iterator()`` instead.
>* ``Sphinx._directive_helper()`` is deprecated. Please use
>  ``sphinx.util.docutils.directive_helper()`` instead.
>* ``BuildEnvironment.set_warnfunc()`` is now deprecated
>* Following methods of ``BuildEnvironment`` is now deprecated.

>  - ``BuildEnvironment.note_toctree()``
>  - ``BuildEnvironment.get_toc_for()``
>  - ``BuildEnvironment.get_toctree_for()``
>  - ``BuildEnvironment.create_index()``

>  Please use ``sphinx.environment.adapters`` modules instead.
>* latex package  ``footnote`` is not loaded anymore by its bundled replacement
>  ``footnotehyper-sphinx``. The redefined macros keep the same names as in the
>  original package.
>* 3429: deprecate config setting ``latex_keep_old_macro_names``. It will be
>  removed at 1.7, and already its default value has changed from ``True`` to
>  ``False``.
>* 3221: epub2 builder is deprecated
>* 3254: ``sphinx.websupport`` is now separated into independent package;
>  ``sphinxcontrib-websupport``.  ``sphinx.websupport`` will be removed in
>  Sphinx-2.0.
>* 3628: ``sphinx_themes`` entry_point is deprecated.  Please use
>  ``sphinx.html_themes`` instead.
