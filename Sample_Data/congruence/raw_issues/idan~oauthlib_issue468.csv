This way of importing is in general strongly discouraged due to namespace pollution and unattended conflicts which could happen.

We've found only 3 occurrences of import * and we fixed all of them:
```
$ grep -R ""from .* import \*"" *
oauth1/__init__.py:from .rfc5849.errors import *
oauth2/__init__.py:from .rfc6749.errors import *
oauth2/rfc6749/clients/__init__.py:from .base import *
```

Please consider merging this PR and include in the next release.

Thank you.","start issue","Changed all implicit imports * with explicit classes imports"
