Unfortunately our plotting tests are a bit long, given that they involve a lot of matplotlib machinery.

Indeed, if the tests start taking too long to run, people won't run them anymore.

To me, this is semantically wrong--if I start with 3D, I should finish with 3D.

The practical problem I hit was while using `nipy`'s plotting functions.  They require 3D data, and this kind of unexpected 4D image made it hard to write generic code there--all other images I was working on were 3D (including others via nilearn functions like `index_img`), but only this one was not.

Here's a script to reproduce the issue.

``` python
import nibabel
from nilearn import datasets
from nilearn.image import index_img
from nilearn.input_data import NiftiMasker

haxby_dataset = datasets.fetch_haxby()
mask_filename = haxby_dataset.mask_vt[0]
func_filename = haxby_dataset.func[0]

nifti_masker = NiftiMasker(mask_img=mask_filename, standardize=True)
fmri_img = index_img(nibabel.load(func_filename), 0)  # 3D image
nifti_masker.fit(fmri_img)
print nifti_masker.mask_img_.shape  # 3D mask

fmri_masked = nifti_masker.transform(fmri_img)
fmri_unmasked = nifti_masker.inverse_transform(fmri_masked)
print fmri_img.shape, fmri_unmasked.shape  # 3D start image, 4D end image

cast to the same 'X' matrix. For one of these two,

The standard choice for scaling signals within ROIs (e.g. MarsBaR, Conn) is to scale them to their own ROI-specific average BOLD signal and multiply by 100 to get what is commonly called Percent Signal Change units. This allows to put all the ROIs to the same range while maintaining the difference in variances between them. 

Below signals within 2 ROIs from ADHD dataset, note that although region 12 has higher average, it has less variance. But after the regression of one confound (average CSF), the variances are almost the same because of this partial standardization achieved in signal.clean. My expected behavior of cleaning is the bottom subplot.

Investigating what is wrong it turns out it is the way the regression of confounds is done. In fact, it relies on a QR decomposition and in case of a unique null confound, the Q matrix is the vector np.array([1, 0, ..., 0]). So the output signal is np.array([0, input[1], ..., input[n]]).

There are two possible explanations: either the normalizing does indeed improve the numerics, and the results are less orthogonal. I think that it would not be the end of the world given that the precision is still very good.

for me this is the reason we need to relax both tests. To be convinced, rerun the same tests on the master with standardize=True (which results in a multiplication of the output signal by some factor) and the tests will not work.

Same remark, I was planning to do a PR about that later.

I prefer to keep data and affine next to each other if possible, makes more sense to me. If we are to change the signature, I suggest that we change the name because I think of this function call as a sentence ""I want a new image like `param1` containing data `param2`"".

For the moment, there is a bug since the code expects _standardize to do a copy of signals and the copy is not done if no treratment is requested.

But as mentioned in an outside comment, this would have been handled by `confounds.dot(pinv(confounds).dot(signal))` also. The only question is where `pinv` cuts off singular values. AFAIK this is at `1e-15`.

14,issue_comment,578,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2015-05-11 07:50:29,"For the record, here is a small code to test accepted types in nibabel:

``` python
import nibabel
import numpy as np


def _nibabel_image_types():
    for i in nibabel.__dict__:
        if i.endswith('Image'):
            yield nibabel.__dict__[i]


types_to_test = [
        np.int8,
        np.uint8,
        np.bool,
        np.float64,
]

for image in _nibabel_image_types():
    supp = []
    unsupp = []
    for t in types_to_test:
        try:
            image(np.zeros((10, 10, 10), dtype=t), np.eye(4))
            supp.append(t)
        except:
            unsupp.append(t)
    print('Type', image)
    print('\tSupported:', supp)
    print('\tUnsupported:', unsupp)
```

And here are the results:

```
Type <class 'nibabel.nifti1.Nifti1Image'>
        Supported: [<class 'numpy.int8'>, <class 'numpy.uint8'>, <class 'numpy.float64'>]
        Unsupported: [<class 'bool'>]

```

So, 2 remarks:
- we should extend the condition to Spm*AnalyzeImage because they don't support int8 either
- when we use internal masks (90% of usecases if masks) we could rely on MincImage format since it supports bool. This would be easier than passing the data and affine separately in all the functions.

I started testing the plotting tools which seem very cool but ran into an issue when trying to overlay my statistical maps which are all 4D images (with the 4th dimension being different tests). I am wondering if there are plans to support slicing in loaded 4D images in the future - dumping each file to 3D individually is possible but seems a bit cumbersome.

Best,
Seb

There are a few examples using index_img and iter_img.

@surchs you are more than welcome to put together an example showing how to plot 4d images with index_img and possibly iter_img.

It should go in examples/manipulating_visualizing and you can use datasets.fetch_nyu_rest (as in examples/plot_nifti_simple.py) to have a 4d image that you can then slice.

1) ""Passed to"" is perfectly fine (cf ""passed by reference"", ""passed by value"" also)
2) check your google search - it probably took away the quotes. If you take away the quotes you get 121e6 results. If you keep them, you get 0.

I would really like to stress that the interpretation of the max heuristic is more clear than that of the sum. In particular, take a network with only one small blob, the sum will be fragile: the background will be contributing more to the decision than the blob.

```

**Expected behavior:**
`check_niimgs` called on an iterator of 3D images to return all images.

**Current behavior:**
`check_niimgs` returns a list, or iterator, with the first image missing.  The output from the above:

```
[<nibabel.nifti1.Nifti1Image object at 0x10b3eaf10>]
[]
<type 'exceptions.StopIteration'>
```

**Notes:**
- I'm not sure what use-cases this would hit.  I expected `mean_img` to call `check_niimgs`, but it does not, nor am I clear when an iterator would be passed to `check_niimgs`.
- When `check_niimgs` runs, it grabs the first image to examine image information.  In the case of an iterator, however, it simply returns the remaining iterator (not a new one that contains the first image that's been popped off.
- I'm not sure the best way to fix this.  Issue #462 was an accidental product of me trying to find a solution to this issue.

Note this has been the case for a while, and is not specific to the relatively recent return_iterator=True in check_niimgs. To make matters worse, I wasn't able to find tests with check_niimg(s) and iterators.

A couple of examples I just found:

``` python
import numpy as np

from nilearn import _utils

affine = np.eye(4)
img_3d = Nifti1Image(np.ones((10, 10, 10)), affine)

img_4d = _utils.check_niimgs(input_iterator)  # Exception in concat_niimgs

input_iterator = iter([img_3d, img_3d])
img_4d = _utils.check_niimg(input_iterator)
img_4d.shape  # (10, 10, 10, 1) instead of (10, 10, 10, 2)

This happens because the first loop to compute the shape works fine but the second loop to set the data never gets run because the iterator has already been consumed in the first one.

The tests are not passing on scipy 0.9.0, which we must support as it is the standard version in one of the ubuntu distributions that we support.

The reason is trivial: the 'pivoting' argument to scipy.linalg.qr was added in version 0.10.1.

The solution is to test for the version of scipy, and use the 'pivoting' only if the version is greater. One example of such code to do this can be found on

I don't know, why would a user pass a threshold parameter if it is not listed as an explicit parameter and not documented?

Maybe the simplest thing to do is actually to go the other way on this one: allow an optional 'threshold' parameter that defaults to None (i.e. not thresholded) in plot_anat ?

My contention with having some kwargs logic is that it is rather brittle. For example should we protect against resampling_interpolation being passed into the kwargs as well? Should we do this only in plot_anat or also in other plot_ functions that set threshold to a fixed value internally?

A bit of both, mainly nilearn's fault.

What happens is that data is loaded in `uint8` type and then some magic happens in the code and the data is converted to `int8` that is not supported by the data format.

IMHO, converting data implictly is utterly wrong.

The problem is that MGH format does not handle int8, only uint8. I can't find an easy way to get accepted types for each format.

Second, I am very worried about supporting mgz. I think that this is feature creep. Very few people use it, and if we try supporting it, I am afraid that it will be broken most often. Our docs clearly talk about 'niimg like', ie NiftiImage like, which mgz is.

I guess that my point of view on this problem is that we will accept a PR fixing it in a clean way, and if people join the dev team to support mgz files, its fine. But I don't feel like allocating our already sparse resources to it.

What could potentially speak against this? (It makes sense from the point of view that `uint8` is in a certain sense a smallest increment in complexity wrt `bool`, but I don't know if there are practical implications that would be counterindications to this choice)

It's less often used (at least in the analyze / nifti world), thus we run
into more chances that a software does not recognize it.
