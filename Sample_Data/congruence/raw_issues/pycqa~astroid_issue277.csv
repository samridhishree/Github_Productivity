Giving the following code:

```
#!python

from astroid.builder import AstroidBuilder
b = AstroidBuilder()
import lxml.etree
f = b.inspect_build(lxml.etree)
f.wildcard_import_names()
```

astroid crashes with

```
#!python

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""a.py"", line 5, in <module>
    f.wildcard_import_names()
  File ""astroid\scoped_nodes.py"", line 471, in wildcard_import_names
    explicit = next(all.assigned_stmts())
TypeError: mulass_assigned_stmts() takes at least 2 arguments (1 given)

```

assigned_stmts methods have the same signature from now on.

They used to have different signatures and each one made
assumptions about what could be passed to other implementations,
leading to various possible crashes when one or more arguments
weren't given. Closes issue #277.
