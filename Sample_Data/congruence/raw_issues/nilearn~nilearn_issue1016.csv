I was wondering if I should include the fsaverage5 surface giftis in that fetcher as well (without them I can't plot the atlas), like I did in the nki fetcher. Or, if there should be an independent fetcher for fsaverage5 (and I remove these files from the nki fetcher as well)?

1. White space around the figure:
   I looked into this but didn't find a solution yet. In the volumetric plotting code, I figure this is the step to adapt the bounds: https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/nilearn/plotting/displays.py#L92-L94 ? 
   But since I don't use imshow here I don't see how to translate it directly. I tried to change the bounding box of the 3d axis with ax.set_clip_box but it didn't help. Maybe one of you has an idea that they could point me to?
2. Example / documentation: 
   I would like to replace the example which plots an arbitrary volume of a time series with one that plots seed-based connectivity of the example dataset. I will look into this asap and then also write a proper documentation of the example. 

Are there any other crucial points for now?

Well, we cannot rely on people having FS installed, so we would need to
provide downloaders, and for this we would need to check that there
exists URLs where we can download them.

## Notes

The 'Destrieux' cortical atlas is based on a parcellation scheme
that first divided the cortex into gyral and sulcal regions,
the limit between both being given by the curvature value of the surface.
A gyrus only includes the cortex visible on the pial view,
the hidden cortex (banks of sulci) are marked sulcus.
The result is a complete labeling of cortical sulci and gyri.
