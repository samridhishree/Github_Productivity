5,issue_comment,240,nilearn,nilearn,lesteve,2014-09-15 13:53:52,"It seems like the the tests are broken because confounds is None by default in MultiPCA.fit so you have problem where you try to iterate in https://github.com/GaelVaroquaux/nilearn/blob/better_pca/nilearn/decomposition/multi_pca.py#L276.

That was already noted in
https://github.com/GaelVaroquaux/nilearn/commit/8448c7a3e3851395d91eff10c493c1a36d581119

I guess you could do something like:

``` python
if confounds is None:
    confounds = [None] * len(niimgs)
```

The merge conflict is very easy to resolve, in case that's what you were asking for.

For completeness, here is the traceback of one of the failing tests:

- Wrap my estimator's fit and score functions to remove the mean and then calculate the fit/score via a call to the parent. Is there anything else I should modify?
- I could modify the `_group_iter_serch_light` (and all functions that call this) to take in another function that would modify the searchlight data before calling `cross_val_score`)

I understand what you want to do but I don't really understand why. Could you elaborate on that so I can target your needs more specifically?

Regarding you solutions:
- Wrapping your estimator is not necessary, you can use sklearn Pipelines to do that. Just make a transformer that removes the mean in the transform() function. However, if you chose this solution, be aware that you will remove the mean on the train set and on thetest set separately. If you want to remove the global mean, this is not the way to go.
- The second solution is, for me, the way to go in your case.

This behavior is not available in nilearn because you have a very specific usecase. Sorry for that.

Those lines should be:

That’s because the 2D array is of shape samples-by-features. Therefore you need to index into the samples dimension with your sessions indices.

The problem with precomputed values is that when things break a few years
down the line, it's harder to diagnose the break down, because you don't
know how the reference has been generated.

The --pylab flag will be removed for IPython **notebook** on IPython 3.0 and is discouraged for other front-ends. Not sure about bog-standard IPython to be entirely fair, but I tend to agree with the general opinion that putting so many things in the main namespace (and shadowing builtins while we are at it like sum and all) is never a great idea.

On top of that I didn't look extensively but I could not find a place in the doc that actually relied on accessing functions that  --pylab puts in the main namespace.
