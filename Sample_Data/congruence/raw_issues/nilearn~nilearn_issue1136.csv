I have made some changes to ensure that the proper interpolation flags get passed all the way down to display.map_show (see my fork for details), and have confirmed that kwargs['interpolation']=='nearest' within map_show.  the values in the plotted stat map are binary, but the resulting plotted image still looks interpolated - see attached image.  any ideas?
