I just installed nilearn following the user guide. I am using an academic license of Enthought Canopy (1.1.1.1452) which is the replacement for EPD. Following the instruction in **1.2.2.2. Setting up** of the [user guide](http://nilearn.github.io/introduction.html#installation) nilearn lands in **.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages** which is by default not part of the canopy path. Therefore the next line in the guide `import nilearn` will fail.

Maybe an additional line in the user guide to on how to add the install location to the path or dropping the --user option will help.

I am asking because it would make sens that the Canopy Python sets up packages in a different location.

"issue_comment","143","nilearn","nilearn","surchs","2013-11-30 15:03:45","Yeah, canopy is my default python and I used it to install nilearn. I got the canopy paths from sys.path() in the canopy IPython shell. However installing with the --user option using canopy python is still successful in the sense that nilearn in the ~/.local path is then accessible to the system python - which however does not have all the other dependencies.

Canopy seems to have its own, separate user path at `Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/lib/python2.7/site-packages`. If I leave the --user option while installing, this is where nilearn ends up. I am not sure what the difference is to `Enthought/Canopy_64bit/System/lib/python2.7/site-packages` which contains less packages.

I've contacted them, because IMHO, it's broken.
