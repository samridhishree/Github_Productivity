"issue_title","353","nilearn","nilearn","AlexandreAbraham","2015-01-16 14:02:11","Many studies use 6mm balls around seeds to extract signal. A Masker could take these seeds and extract the corresponding signal. I already have some code to get the sphere around a seed in MNI space:

``` python
def _sqr_distance_matrix(array, affine, seed):
    # You need a lot of faith to believe in this code!
    seed = np.asarray(seed)
    # Create an array of shape (3, array.shape) containing the i, j, k indices
    indices = np.vstack((np.indices(array.shape), np.ones((1,) + array.shape)))
    # Transform the indices into original space
    indices = np.tensordot(affine, indices, axes=[[1], [0]])[:3]
    # Compute square distance to the seed
    indices = ((indices - seed[:, None, None, None]) ** 2).sum(axis=0)
    return indices


def _create_sphere(array, affine, seed, radius):
    dist = _sqr_distance_matrix(array, affine, seed)
    array[dist <= radius ** 2] = 1
```

Note that this code use a bit of memory in `_sqr_distance_matrix` and could be optimized (at the cost of execution time). But if it is called seed by seed it shouldn't be a problem.

+1. I am the one who suggested it :$

That would be a horrible misnomer. A seed is not necessary a ball. And
the ball is not always used for seeding (eg with graph analyses). While
the sphere/ball is a small misnomer, that one would be misleading.

Some cosmetics / potential benchmark questions:
- I'd use `np.concatenate([...], axis=0)` instead of `np.vstack` just to be clear what is being done
- apart from `np.tensordot`, there is also the option to just `reshape(4, -1)` and `np.dot` (probably faster). (And the slower option: `np.einsum`)
- [We may be able to transform the other way round, i.e. transform the seed into voxel space. For (up to permutation) symmetric 3x3 parts of the affine, we would then be able to just shrink or dilate along the principle axes and thus be able to use `ogrid`. But that is probably way to complicated for the simple generation of a mask]
- `None == np.newaxis`
- `NiftiBallsMasker` is a funny name in a slightly unfortunate way :) (Might have to use the misnomer _sphere_ to avoid this ...)

Why does `_create_sphere` set that part of `array` to 1? Is the rest known to be 0?

Gaël suggested it and I did not change it on purpose. For the same reason, we used the word ""sphere"" instead of ""ball"" in the SearchLight code/documentation and the main feedback I had on this was ""but Searchlight uses balls, not spheres"". A sphere is a surface, a ball is a volume and people knows that. If you have a solution to make the name more serious, I'd like to know it, but I think that using ""sphere"" would be a mistake.

However, I think the effect of names is not to be underestimated and it is beneficial to avoid sources of awkwardness where we can ... :)

@bcipolli I think that is probably the best option. Thanks for the suggestion!

Otherwise something like `NiftiRadiusMasker` should probably be descriptive enough as well.

Just to point it out in case it wasn't obvious already: the slightly annoying thing with NiftiBallMasker (without s) is that the other maskers use the plural: NiftiLabel**s**Masker, NiftiMap**s**Masker.
