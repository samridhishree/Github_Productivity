```
cv = StratifiedKFold(n_folds=2,y=y)

decoder = SpaceNetClassifier(cv=cv, memory=""nilearn_cache"", penalty='tv-l1', memory_level=2, n_jobs=2, verbose=1, screening_percentile=20, mask= './mni_152_gm.nii')
decoder.fit(X, y)
```

According to the [Reference](http://nilearn.github.io/modules/generated/nilearn.decoding.SpaceNetClassifier.html),  there should be a decoder.alpha_ attribute. However, this does not exist when I inspect the decoder.

How to get the decoding accuracy without the best alpha from cv? Were there changes to SpaceNetClassifier since the reference page was last updated?","start issue","No alpha_ attribute in SpaceNetClassifier decoder"

The attribute you are interested in is
 `best_model_params_` : ndarray, shape (n_folds, n_parameter)
        Best model parameters (alpha, l1_ratio) saved for the different
        cross-validation folds.","",""

I don't know the algorithm very well too. But, pointing towards to look more closely into it. I can update your question soon.
