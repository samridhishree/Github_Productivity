I don't understand. On my box, I have a battery of tests there. I don't
have time to check what is going on (am in a Starbucks), but there should
be 100% test coverage on multi_pca.py

In the current state, components are un-masked in `MultiPCA.fit` (multi_pca.py:240), and masked again in transform, through the call to NiftiMapsMasker.transform (multi_pca.py:263). The present state works fine, but it will use too much time and memory for no good reason (`self.components_` and `self.components_img_` are the same -big- thing, and conversion between them is performed multiple times). 

However, in the present state, there is no way to pass masked data to NiftiMapsMasker, meaning that  `self.components_` will have to be unmasked at some point. Thus, it's `self.components_` that must be dropped, at least until some optimization is performed.

Another performance issue: it seems that `components_img_` is computed twice in some cases. `CanICA.fit` calls `MultiPCA.fit`, and both call `masker_.inverse_transform`. This precise problem can be solved by doing lazy evaluation.

For internals, we need components_ (for instance to get MultiPCA to talk
to ICA, or for the transform), so I am +1 to keep components_ rather than
components_img_

We should instruct people to use
multi_pca.masker_.inverse_transform(multi_pca.components_)

How about short-circuiting this object and using it's internals rather
than the full object (i.e. a function that does the work rather than the
method)?

Yes. So we need to test for full_version. If it's not present, we know we
have an old numpy.

Not memorizing it: it is fast to compute and not worth the speed/time
tradeoff of caching. If we can avoid recomputing be rearranging the code
it is better.

Well the reason I used it, is that the code without it breaks on a dev
version. This needs to be sorted out. Sorry, I don't have time to look at
