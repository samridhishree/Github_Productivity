Hi !

Just found a regression with astroid 1.4

In https://bitbucket.org/logilab/astroid/commits/9367f99b6d66f63b482f32da5d944e56fb2fdb02#Lastroid/as_string.pyF271, the visit_functiondef method switched from `%` to `.format`, which fails on unicode characters.

With python 2.7:

``` python
>>> b""%s"" % u""\u2019""
u'\u2019'
>>> b""{}"".format(u""\u2019"")
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\u2019' in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)
```

Which means that docstrings in particular can't contain non-ascii characters..

Reverting to `%` is enough. Do you want a pull request ?

Can't get my head around mercurial ...

Use printf-style formatting in as_string, in order
 to avoid a potential problem with encodings when using .format.

Closes issue #273.

Ah, I forgot to credit you, I'm sorry. I added your username in the ChangeLog though (https://bitbucket.org/logilab/astroid/commits/3f46c677c4b8f72372bcc840e6534aa0120a7613), since I can't edit the commits after being pushed.

Thank you! This was a major headache today when a dependency (path.py) used a Unicode character in its docs and suddenly pylint was dying.
