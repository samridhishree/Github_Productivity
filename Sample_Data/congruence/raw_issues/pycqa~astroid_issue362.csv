When `functool` imported, `pylint` tries to access `visit_joinedstr` in `TreeRebuilder3k` (`astroid`: `rebuild.py`). 

Apparently, the `node` points to line 286 col 20 (I presume, in the `functool.py` -- please disregard this paragraph otherwise):

``` py
        args.extend(f""{k}={v!r}"" for (k, v) in self.keywords.items())
                   ^^^
```

I also created [`pylint` issue #1113](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/1113) (sorry for noise, I am not sure what is the best place).
### Steps to reproduce
1. Create `test.py`:

``` py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import functools
```
1. run pylint:

``` sh
> pylint test.py
```
### Current behavior

```
