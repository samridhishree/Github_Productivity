"issue_title","196","nilearn","nilearn","VirgileFritsch","2014-05-22 12:10:59","Tadaaaaam... Implementation of Randomized Parcellation Based Inference [1].

Main accomplished tasks:
- Refactoring: move some functions that were common to permuted OLS and RPBI into a utils.py file.
  orthonormalize_design/matrix, f_score computation, ...
  Tests have been changed accordingly.
- Re-introduce GrowableSparseArrays (and corresponding tests).
  They have already been reviewed in a former PR about permuted OLS before they were finally removed.
  Now, we needed to re-introduce them because we need to address the data efficiently, in different 
  manners and for different purposes.
- Introduce some functions to generate/deal with randomized parcellations.
  They could be moved to a more generic module that serves this purpose (creating multiple
  random parcellations, transforming a dataset with all of the built parcellations)
- Examples: the three examples on massively univariate analysis have been duplicated and RPBI is now
  applied. This is a lot of examples, but they will be structured at some point (see issue #195).
  Issue: examples can take up to 30 minutes on a laptop, using one single CPU (see discussion below).

The code for RPBI is optimized but a run of the algorithm remains costly. This is because RPBI requires the computation of many parcellations (97% of the total execution time). Only 3% of the computation time is spent on the permutations, when 10,000 are performed (which is already kind of a lot, but recommended).
Fortunately, both the computation of the parcellation and the statistical inference part can be parallelized.
Therefore, on a 10-core station, the computation time boils down to less than three minutes, which is acceptable. Still, the examples policy requires that n_jobs=1 by default.

However, that would mean that the user is trying to normalize a matrix with at least one column of zeroes. Note that it is close to happening in the Oasis example, where we actually need some workaround to exclude to voxels with a zero between-subject variance from the analysis.

The correction I propose is the following:
- We catch the design problem (i.e. column(s) of zeros) early
- We raise a warning
- We use a inner mask in order to perform the analysis on the remaining, correct columns
- We return the results with zeros where there were some initially (using the inner mask again).

> The array should only know about data and indices.

The convenient thing with GrowableSparseArrays is that you provide data to them, and they decide what they should store or not, depending on the threshold with which they have been initialized. The user does not have to worry about thresholding the data himself.
Besides, if the object ""knows"" what values it contains, it becomes self-content.

Here I do not agree. I think it is up to the object to select the data that it stores. that way it can be ""fed"" transparently.
Once the threshold has been set up --depending on the type of values we want the GSArray to contain-- there is nothing to do but appending data and merging GSArrays together. That behavior makes the GSArrays usable as black boxes, which is an important feature for a data structure. Would the threshold be the responsibility of the developer, it would separate the theoretical properties of the object (i.e. ""it is suppose to contain data above a given threshold"") and what happen in practice (i.e. ""is it really the case?"").

> I especially do not want it to be generic in any sense

Yet I have been asked to name its entries with generic names (""x"", ""y"", ""iter"") ;-)
(see https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/157#discussion_r9372040, and one other former comment of yours: _""I think that the ides is that the structure is fed by some iterations of a given estimator, that might be a permuted estimator.""_)
For me it is not a matter of genericity, but a matter of modularity.

No, there can be more than one tested variate (RPBI returns a n_tested_vars by n_voxels array). But you raise a good point since I think it is not tested.

I think that I made the same remark a while ago: the object should be a
data structure that is agnostic of its usage. The thresholding thing is
something that is related to the RPBI, it should not be in the
GrowableSparseArray. The logic behind this is that the code needs to be
understandable bits by bits, and not only after reading and processing
the whole code. Thus the GrowableSparseArray should do nothing more than
be a growable sparse array.

Note that  when I first looked at the code in February, I was trying to figure out how it worked: I was not commenting on the philospophy. I am increasingly worried about the maintenance burden. In particular, I am now really in favor of removing any complex logic that  may be hidden in GrowableSparseArrays. Specifically, 
- if none of our example uses a given dimension of the array, it has to be removed.
- If there is no scenario in which the threshold is changing, we should not even consider this possibility (actually, no user should be in position of using these structures)
- the thresholding operation has to be kept outside of the object.
  Please consider that it should be nothing but the simplest way to store and append sparse informations generated by a black box. In short, I want to it to be the minimal code that can be used to run the current examples of the library. We're not too far from that point.

Agreed: it shouldn't attempt to catter for all the usecases. It should

No. People need to be able to build a mental picture of what it does
without reader the whole code. Elsewhere it is hopeless to try to

To me, the lines above do not make sens: mask_img should either be a
niimg-like, or an ndarray, but it should not have both options possible.
We want to separate clearly the world of niimgs and of ndarrays.

Wait, why? It stays a niimg, and the naming convention is that all niimgs
should end with _img.
