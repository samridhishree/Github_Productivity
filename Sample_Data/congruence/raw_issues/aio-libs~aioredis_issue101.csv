```
/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.5.0/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/asyncio/tasks.py:509: DeprecationWarning: asyncio.async() function is deprecated, use ensure_future()
```

Python 3.5 suggests that `asyncio.async` should be replaced by `asyncio.ensure_future`.

One possible solution: 

``` python
try:
    from asyncio import ensure_future as asyncio_ensure_future
except ImportError:
    from asyncio import async as asyncio_ensure_future
```

Then, use `asyncio_ensure_future` to replace all the `asyncio.async` in the codes.
