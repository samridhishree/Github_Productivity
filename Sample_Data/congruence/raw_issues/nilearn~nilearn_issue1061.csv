On Python, $USER has no meaning by the way, I don't think it improves readability (which was the only reason for my change `varoquau/dev/nilearn` → `user`).

The line that you're rightly replacing corresponds to another script: plot_haxby_anova_svm.py.
in the context of this tutorial, the classification rate is what you got, no question about that.
So, I'm fine with the change.
