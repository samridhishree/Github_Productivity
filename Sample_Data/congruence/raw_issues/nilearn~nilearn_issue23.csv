- accuracy of haxby_decoding is impacted (now about 0.99) and I have changed the documentation accordingly
- LDA results in the ""going further"" part are impacted too : there was results using the entire dataset instead of restricting to face and houses

All generated figures are identical.

we have a 100% accuracy now? isn't that to good to be true?
