```
Since Redis 3.0.3 the command accepts a variable number of keys
```

But in [source code](https://github.com/aio-libs/aioredis/blob/master/aioredis/commands/generic.py#L22) accepts only one key:

```
def exists(self, key):
    """"""Check if key exists.""""""
    fut = self._conn.execute(b'EXISTS', key)
    return wait_convert(fut, bool)
```

Thanks!
