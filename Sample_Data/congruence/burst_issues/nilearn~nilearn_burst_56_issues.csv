There is an iterator to iterate on non-first dimensions, it is `np.nested_iters`. However this is not the fastest solution, transposing the axes is even faster. It has to be noted that, for that particular purpose, a `nditer` may be the faster solution because it would iter on both arrays at the same time.

Here is a small bench to convince you.

``` python
import numpy as np
import time


a = np.random.random((20, 30, 40, 5, 6))

t0 = time.time()
for i in range(100):
    all_img = (slice(None), ) * 3
    other_shape = a.shape[3:]
    for ind in np.ndindex(*other_shape):
        a[all_img + ind].shape
print time.time() - t0

t0 = time.time()
for i in range(100):
    it0, it1 = np.nested_iters(a, [range(3, a.ndim), [0, 1, 2]], flags=['multi_index'])
    for x in it0:
        it1.itviews[0].shape
print time.time() - t0

t0 = time.time()
for i in range(100):
    other_shape = a.shape[3:]
    b = np.transpose(a, range(3, a.ndim) + [0, 1, 2])

This is a pip related problem because root doesn't own the current directory. Doing `cd /tmp && sudo pip install -U --user nilearn` fixes the problem.

> I re-ran with sudo with a -H flag and got the following output (again some warnings)...

Obviously it works because `-H` changes your `$HOME` variable and thus pip ends up installing in root's home, which is owned by root. Note that updating pip should also fix the issue.

> I wasn't sure how important the SSL warnings were? 

Not important when it comes to downloading software.

I've tracked down the issue to [this line of code](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/0.1.3/nilearn/plotting/displays.py#L532). The `img` object that goes into the `reorder_img` function has a masked data array, but the `img` that comes out of it just has a bare float array of 1s and 0s (in the case of the ROI image).

My native space images have a LPS orientation; presumably the mask  information is getting lost somewhere as the data are reordered to RAS. Presumably that step is skipped for the Haxby data, which are already oriented properly, and that is why the examples look fine.

I'm using nilearn 1.3.

Do you mean the images themselves? Sure I can do that when I get to school.

Why do you say that? I would have expected much of the overlay would be transparent (z = 9 is a high threshold) and that we would see the gray colormapped mean epi image in those spots.

What happens when you make an affine with rotations?

Good point, I can reproduce the problem, the reordered_img lose the mask for some reason which needs to be elucidated:

``` python
import numpy as np
import nibabel as nib

from nilearn import image, plotting

data = np.random.randn(20, 20, 20)
data = np.ma.masked_less(data, 0.)

# matrix with rotation
affine = np.array([[-3., 1., 0., 1.],
                   [-1., -3., 0., -2.],
                   [0., 0., 3., 3.],
                   [0., 0., 0., 1.]])
img = nib.Nifti1Image(data, affine)

reordered_img = image.reorder_img(img, resample='continuous')
print('img data type:', type(img.get_data()))  # numpy.ma.core.MaskedArray
print('reordered_img data type:', type(reordered_img.get_data()))  # numpy.ndarray
```

This seems more related to affine with rotations rather than LPS vs RAS by the way.

It's going to be the resampling.

One thing that we could do would be to move this reordering before we
apply the threshold. The other option is to resample the mask, but that's
going to be ugly (resampling discrete info is not something that I like).

That sounds like the right order of operations to me, although I am (much) less familiar with the codebase.

non affine with rotation) we don't support user masks.

One way to do what you want with the existing code is something like:

``` python

display = plotting.plot_roi(roi_nii, annotate=False)
display.title('roi_label', size=12, color='k', bgcolor='w', weight='bold', alpha=0.)
display.annotate(size=12)
```

My take on it is that we are trying to fight against adding more complexity in the plotting code but ccing @GaelVaroquaux and @AlexandreAbraham for their opinions on the matter.

The rationale is that plotting.plot_\* functions should cover the most basic use cases. If you need more tweaking it can be done via the 'display' objects that these functions return.

That looks just as easy.  I should have looked more closely to see that the object was returned and you could just set it then as in matplotlib!  

Perhaps, something along these lines could be added to one of the examples here:

Just say 'formats read by nibabel' without 'any'. That way it is vague.
In a footnote be more precise.
