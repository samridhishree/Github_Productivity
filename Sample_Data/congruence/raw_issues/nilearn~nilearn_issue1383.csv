I've found out that you perform a smoothing to find cut slices coordinates. For that, just before calling `_smooth_array` you convert the data type to float in:
https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/nilearn/plotting/find_cuts.py#L228

My issue is in that some atlases have a ""np.uint8"" dtype, in this case `data.dtype.kind` is 'u', not 'i' as expected.

The following change solved my problem. Do you think it is a reasonable change for Nilearn?
```
if data.dtype.kind in ('i', 'u'):
    data = data.astype(np.float)

Yes, preceeded by a comment that explains why it's necessary. Thanks!
