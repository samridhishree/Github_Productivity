On http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/plot_canica_resting_state.html (the only page that is returned when putting canica in the search box), the figures are not labeled, hence it is difficult to know what we are looking at (although we might have a good guess).
## code output

Also the code output is shown before the actual source code, which is a little surprising (I did not expect to see the source code appear scrolling through the ouput)

I will do a simple fix using CSS and overflow: scroll

Showing the output before the code is not illogic : we show the figures before the code, which is part of the output of the script. However, I agree that such a long output should not be shown. We should first reduce the verbosity of the objects. Second, I think that these debug output are done on stderr, not on stdout. We should not capture stdout, but it has to be verified.
