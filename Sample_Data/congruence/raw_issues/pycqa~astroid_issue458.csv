ast_objects.inv contains the [Green Tree Snakes](http://greentreesnakes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) documentation inventory, but with the classes prepended with `ast` so that they don't conflict with astroid nodes and therefore we can still link to `ast` documentation.","start issue","Public facing node documentation"

I think it would help if we could add an empty line between these blocks (attribute + docstring + newline).

That's maybe a bit more conventional, and it won't spread out the code too much?","3c70cc4cbfc774dfdf7bc05094bc1e0dad56e30e","(None, '', u'astroid/node_classes.py')"
