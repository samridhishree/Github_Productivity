1) the type of the output changes if `symmetric_split` is True or False

``` Python
from nilearn import datasets
atlas = datasets.fetch_atlas_harvard_oxford('cort-maxprob-thr25-1mm', symmetric_split=True)
type(atlas['labels']), type(atlas['maps'])
```

(list, nibabel.nifti1.Nifti1Image)

``` Python
atlas = datasets.fetch_atlas_harvard_oxford('cort-maxprob-thr25-1mm', symmetric_split=False)
type(atlas['labels']), type(atlas['maps'])
```

(numpy.ndarray, str)
2) the parameter `symmetric_split` is allowed to be True for `'sub-maxprob-thr25-1mm'` but 

``` Python
datasets.fetch_atlas_harvard_oxford('sub-maxprob-thr25-1mm', symmetric_split=True)
```

throws an error `RuntimeError: data type not supported`.  May be not allowing for subcortical atlases as their labels already contain the information right/left

You're right, I'll fix it.

Already splitted atlases should not be splitted again. The atlas you plot is actually not modified in our but the list of labels is modified even when it should not be. The code for that is quite horrible, I will rewrite it.

However, I have no RuntimeError, could you give me the trace of the error?

Like I said, the labels returned by the function when `symmetric_split=True` are wrong.

``` Python
atlas = datasets.fetch_atlas_harvard_oxford('cort-maxprob-thr25-1mm', symmetric_split=True)
```

`print(atlas.labels[:5])` gives the right regions

``` Python
['Background', 'Frontal Pole, right part', 'Insular Cortex, right part', 'Superior Frontal Gyrus, right part', 'Middle Frontal Gyrus, right part']
```

while `print(atlas.labels[-5:])` gives the left regions 

``` Python
['Planum Polare, left part', ""Heschl's Gyrus (includes H1 and H2), left part"", 'Planum Temporale, left part', 'Supracalcarine Cortex, left part', 'Occipital Pole, left part']
```

but when plotting they seem to me inverted because I expected the intensity growing from 0 for the Background to its maximum in occipital regions. Did I get something wrong ?

``` Python
from nilearn import plotting
plotting.plot_stat_map(atlas.maps)
```

Thanks ! and what about the right/left labels, is there a mismatch ?
