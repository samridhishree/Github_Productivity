The standard choice for scaling signals within ROIs (e.g. MarsBaR, Conn) is to scale them to their own ROI-specific average BOLD signal and multiply by 100 to get what is commonly called Percent Signal Change units. This allows to put all the ROIs to the same range while maintaining the difference in variances between them. 

Below signals within 2 ROIs from ADHD dataset, note that although region 12 has higher average, it has less variance. But after the regression of one confound (average CSF), the variances are almost the same because of this partial standardization achieved in signal.clean. My expected behavior of cleaning is the bottom subplot.

Ok so we get as output of cleaning the raw signal after regressing out the confounds and if one is interested by PSC units he can just get the means from the initial signals and scales the signals.

Investigating what is wrong it turns out it is the way the regression of confounds is done. In fact, it relies on a QR decomposition and in case of a unique null confound, the Q matrix is the vector np.array([1, 0, ..., 0]). So the output signal is np.array([0, input[1], ..., input[n]]).

There are two possible explanations: either the normalizing does indeed improve the numerics, and the results are less orthogonal. I think that it would not be the end of the world given that the precision is still very good.

Or options: the norm of residuals is really related to the norm of what goes in. Relative errors are what it meaningful, not absolute. Thus, it is normal that it goes up.

for me this is the reason we need to relax both tests. To be convinced, rerun the same tests on the master with standardize=True (which results in a multiplication of the output signal by some factor) and the tests will not work.

This has recently come up in joblib. I suggest prepending a very short

OK. Part of the problem will be addressed by a functionning cache
replacement policy system in joblib.

The other part of the problem is a general provenance/information problem
that is so far an open problem in software (nobody has solved it in a
good way).

That said, the relevant information is in the joblib store: in each
result directory there is a 'metadata.json'

A function to crawl such information and give a good view of the store
would probably be useful. For instance a 'list' method on the 'memory'
object, that could take an optional function as an argument (in which
case it would list only the content of the cache for this function.

I think that this would be useful. Can you open an issue on the joblib
tracker?

1. In all examples, the maskers have `""nilearn_cache""` as cache directory. We should replace that by `""nilearn_cache/dataset_name""`. Because when users realize this fact, it's already too late and they have a huge cache directory.

Yes and no: there are common things across the different datasets, and
the benefit of putting everything in the same directory is that these
common things are not duplicated or recomputed.

That's always going to be custom and never going to scale, because you
need to know which parameters should go where.

From what I hear, all these problems are problems that we cannot solve.

What we can do, is try to implement a cache replacement policy, and be
able to limit the disk occupied by caching. This is on my radar.

That works for the masker: the first level is everything but the filepath.

My guess is that people will get scared if things that used to run smoothly (because cached) become slow (because cache has been invalidated).

Yes. Loading the haxby dataset and applying to it 2 different
classifiers.

Yes, but it means that you need to hand craft this everywhere, which is
really what I am trying to avoid.

People have long stopped understanding how a computer works. There are
caching mechanisms everywhere in a computer. Some day things are fast.
Other days they are slow. The world is still a better place with caching

I was just thinking of the masker for that point.

I have no strong feeling about that. I just had several complaints about a `nilearn_cache` directory growing out of control and people not wanting to delete it by fear of losing all their cache.

OK. Point taken. I agree with you. Sorry, I was being dumb. I would
welcome a joblib cache per dataset as long as we don't have a cache
replacement policy.

That tells me we need cache replacement policy :). That's difficult work,
but it is feasible, and it will solve many problems at once.

Cool, I'll do a PR to fix that.

I agree. Adding a subdirectory to nilearn_cache is basically the idea of a two level cache but handled at user level ;). I think it can be more useful to sensibilize users to this problem rather than doing everything for them.

I think that having two functions is saner because:
- the 4D would make call to the 3D function (which is better than having recurrence and `if` statements)
- some functionalities are exclusive to the 4D function (`return_iterator` for example).

You way want to take a look at the threshold argument as well as at the vmax argument.

I tried out some binary nifti image (only zeros and ones). I could not reproduce a crash, yet:
I found that this line actually caused the (binary) data in img not be shown in my case -> that is, the map was empty but normal when this array masking was commented out

```

I expected that it would have one of the two semantics:
1. `NiftiMasker` will detrend to compute the mask, then the detrending computed on the mask would be applied to the image passed to `transform`
2. `NiftiMasker` will detrend to compute the mask, and will not detrend input data.

Instead a third semantic was applied:
- `NiftiMasker` detrends to compute the mask.  It then detrends any image that it receives (even if that image is 3D), _using the input images only_.

I'm not sure what the designed behavior is (or why), but at the very least a warning would be helpful.  When I passed a 3D image into a masker with `detrend=True`, I got an image  back out that was all zeros.

Note: this probably also applies to standardize.

Otherwise, the functionality doesn't seem shocking to me: Every 4D image has different temporal trends that need to be removed somewhere in the pipeline. Hence semantic 1 is not useful. Semantic 2 is a possible point for confusion, which may be resolved by renaming the keyword `detrend=` to `detrend_data=`, but I am not sure whether that is necessary. The mask is always computed on undetrended images AFAIK, and both masking strategies employ mean images.

Combining masks can be done using e.g. `nilearn.masking.intersect_masks` or by working on the binary masks directly.

Scikit-learn convention forbids the use of keyword arguments in `fit` and `transform`.

I still find it odd that detrending to compute the mask, and detrending on the data passed to the transform, are semantically tied.  I'd rather have my image class know how to detrend and standardize, it doesn't seem like a ""Masking"" operation to me.  

I think I'd prefer a `normalize_img` function (that takes `detrend` and `standardize` as parameters), and use Masks for computing and applying spatial masks.

As far as I remember and as far as I can tell by skimming over the code, detrending is not performed to compute the mask, neither for `compute_epi_mask`, nor for `compute_background_mask`. Both are called from [here](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/nilearn/input_data/nifti_masker.py#L165).

>  I want the detrending computed across the entire dataset 

valid point, especially when you are extracting very few, non-contiguous conditions. The masker should actually do its job before this extraction. Otherwise you need to switch detrending off, which it is by default in order to avoid surprises.

The `NiftiMasker` is supposed to facilitate ""data preparation"" such as masking and optionally smoothing and detrending, which one often gets wrong if one applies them separately (e.g. in the smoothing case forgetting anisotropic voxel sizes)

That said, it is true that it is quite bloated with functionality.

I would like to keep the color range fix and, for example, to plot values equal to 0.8 in orange, even if 1 values doesn't really exist in this particular map. The reason is because I have other maps where I want the 1s appearing in red.
Is this possible?

Thank you in advance,
fab

I propose a refactor of the structure, to make it easier to understand. Here are the notes and proposed layout from brainstorming with @banilo and @AlexandreAbraham :
# Introduction: nilearn, how and what for?
## Nilearn: MVPA and machine learning for neuroimaging

Here: define and relate to other things that people know

Set the problem, use the right words and give our added value

Right words: functional connectivity, parcellation, connectomes, MVPA, decoding, ...

Have a table/list linking sections of the docs to different modalities (VBM, Task, resting state)

Our added value:
- very simple (a few lines of code) access to advanced methods
- we scale (fast, memory usage...)
- we enable easy prototyping for experimentation and method development
- what we provide in the wider problem of learning on brain images is
  really feature engineering
## Installing nilearn
# Decoding: predicting from brain images
## An example
## Advanced methods
# Functional connectivity and resting state
## Extracting times series to build a functional connectome
## Extracting networks: ICA and beyond
## Clustering: learning a brain parcellation
# Image manipulation and visualization
## Plotting brain images
## Loading images and NiftiMasker

Explain here that the concept of loading images doesn't really exist in nilearn: you can just pass file names to functions. Define what a niimage is
## ROIs and masks
## Datasets integrated in nilearn
- Example datasets
- Atlases
# Advanced usage: pipelines and scaling up
## Example of a hand-crafted analysis pipeline
## Caching
## Multi-core: parallel computing

Keeping a local version doesn't mean that we will branch. The idea is to
have a synchronization script that copies exactly the sphinx-gallery code
in the projects that use it. In these projects it should never be
modified. One example of this pattern is how joblib is integrated in
scikit-learn, in sklearn/externals.

> Isn't it better to use the git version installed in develop mode more

More practical for you. It raises two problems. One is of technicality.
It's one more thing to learn and master for a contributor. These things
pile up and make it harder and harder to contribute to a project. The
second problem is that it means that any backword incompatible change or
bug introduce in sphinx-gallery will break the projects using it.
Decoupling is a good thing.

:+1:. We cannot have a joblib dependency.

I would actually favor not using joblib but a simple shelve, and a test
to see if the URL is already in the shelve.

Here is some pseudo code to implement what I have in mind:

<pre>
import shelve
mem = shelve.open('foo')
if not url in mem:
    data = get_url(url)
    mem[url] = data
    mem.sync()
else:
    data = mem[url]
</pre>

I'd rather not. Creeping dependencies are a problem, and we must tackle
them. The pseudo code that I have given demonstrates how easy it is to
use shelve.

I guess it's up to each project to make a choice whether they want to ship sphinx-gallery or not. The main point of doing so is pure convenience for people generating the doc.

About sphinx-gallery evolving separately in different projects, there is an implicit agreement that only released versions of sphinx-gallery should be used and that potential changes should be propagated upstream.

> I was having a look at the scikit-learn externals. It is a static set of code that gets updated manually, why? and why the extra install scripts within that module?

I guess convenience again is the main reason. Users are spared having to install a few packages in order to use scikit-learn. I think the technical term is vendorizing, you may want to see what the internet has to say about it. I didn't know about the extra install scripts in external so I can't help on this one.

Publishing sphinx-gallery as 0.0.7 with the shelve is straight forward, can upload to pypi now. But I wouldn't launch it yet as a stable release. As some to do from @GaelVaroquaux are still missing. https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/issues/20

Fair enough, how long do you need roughly to be reasonably confident there is no major issues?

I think your comments are related to sphinx-gallery and not nilearn. I reckon we should merge this PR. The alternative is for your comments to be addressed in sphinx-gallery and a new sphinx-gallery release to be made before we can merge this PR. This seems a little bit too much overhead for what it is worth IMHO.

Just for clarity we'll try to keep the sphinx-gallery copy inside nilearn in sync with the latest sphinx-gallery release going forward, which means that if your comments get addressed in sphinx-gallery they will eventually reach the nilearn sphinx-gallery copy.

The good: no extra package to install to generate the doc for nilearn, scikit-learn, and other packages users that have scikit-learn installed.

The not that great: a tiny bit of scikit-learn specific code for projects that are potentially unrelated. 

I was thinking something along those lines (but with a better error message):

``` python
try:
    import joblib
except ImportError as exc_joblib:
    try:
        from sklearn.externals import joblib
    except ImportError as exc_sklearn_joblib:
        exc_sklearn_joblib.args += ('joblib or scikit-learn needs to be installed',)

I would be inclined to say let's just use the joblib + sklearn.externals.joblib fall-back for now so that we can merge this PR.

As far as I know, the two projects that are closer to start using sphinx-gallery are nilearn and scikit-learn anyway.

Actually not such a fair point, since the import joblib would work for the sphinx-gallery CI but I agree the shelve solution doesn't seem so hard and is the right way to do it.

affine = np.eye(4)
img_3d = Nifti1Image(np.ones((10, 10, 10)), affine)

input_iterator = itertools.chain([img_3d], [img_3d])
img_4d = _utils.check_niimg_4d(input_iterator)
print(img_4d.shape)  # (10, 10, 10, 2) which is correct
print(img_4d.get_data())  # uninitialised data rather than ones
```

This happens because the first loop to compute the shape works fine but the second loop to set the data never gets run because the iterator has already been consumed in the first one.

All I am trying to say is that the check should be whether `niimgs` is an iterator rather than a generator.

- if data is not loaded (ie filenames), then we browse the list and get the lengths of the files (it is costless because we only read the header of the file). Then we preallocate a big numpy array: this saves memory and is faster.
- if the data is loaded, then we can also browse and get the length since it's already in memory.
- if the data given is a generator (meaning that we can browse it only once), then we should put the images in a list and concatenate them afterwards.

Does that answer your question? I can see in the code that you removed all the logic of memory pre-allocation. This is not what we want.

One thing that would be possible with the current code would be to
threshold the map that you have to keep only the negative valuen, plot it
using the current glass brain and a blueish colormap. Than plot the
positive values only using the add_overlay method of the display returned

I don't know, why would a user pass a threshold parameter if it is not listed as an explicit parameter and not documented?

Maybe the simplest thing to do is actually to go the other way on this one: allow an optional 'threshold' parameter that defaults to None (i.e. not thresholded) in plot_anat ?

My contention with having some kwargs logic is that it is rather brittle. For example should we protect against resampling_interpolation being passed into the kwargs as well? Should we do this only in plot_anat or also in other plot_ functions that set threshold to a fixed value internally?
