Okay, no worries. I have some example python code that might be good to share as examples for setting up the provider side of things, that area is sadly lacking on the web. I'll get around to making sure all tests are running with it and take out anything specific to last project. Then push it up, probably after Christmas sometime :)

I notice that you didn't include the in validate_token_request under AuthorizationCodeGrant. Did yo put it somewhere else? This takes care of making sure the consumer passes the same redirect_uri with the token request as they did with the initial auth request.

```
    # validate_redirect_uri must be provided by the
    # subclass validator and Check that the redirect uri is the same
    # as the one passed in with Authorisation end point.
    redirect_uri = getattr(request, 'redirect_uri', None)
    if not self.request_validator.validate_redirect_uri(request.client, redirect_uri):
        raise errors.InvalidRequestError()
```

framework neutral that's even better.

If you (or others reading this) are feeling ambitious there is an unfilled
place on the interwebs for a django-oauth2provider extension and I'm sure
other frameworks are lacking as well. I'd love to help out with this when
the oauthlib side of things stabilize but doubt I have time to lead the
efforts myself.

I'm planning quite a few changes in regard to tricky exceptions such as
when a redirect URI is invalid or missing as this need to be handled on the
provider side outside of the scope of oauthlib and not through a response
to the client. I'm also very keen on making this compliant with the RFC and
I think there are several cases which do not match currently. I'll try and
get this done during the holidays and will track my plans and progress
somewhere. On a high level I plan to move everything that can be taken care
of automatically (such as checking fields) into the grants and have all
methods which need to be implemented in the request validator. Furthermore
I plan to differentiate exceptions into two classes, one which can be
serialized into a response and one that must be acted upon by the provider.
The latter is mainly present in the auth code grant and the implicit grant.

Keep up the good work!

"issue_comment","82","idan","oauthlib","Chez","2012-12-20 19:16:55","I have quite a bit of Django experience, so might be interested, what sort of commitment does it require?

Separating data/modeling requirements is the trickiest bit to making anything framework independent, but there are ways and means. I'm planning to write a data abstraction layer (bunch of wrappers) for my latest project which is in GAE. 

As for your plans, sounds like a plan :) However, I have to go revisit the code again for a thorough walk through. Have been busy writing a spec for a personal project the last week. One thing I would want to do is consider the possibilities to separate provider vs client code into different packages so that you do not need to include all the code in both.
