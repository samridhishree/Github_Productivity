It shows the different plot_\* functions. The advanced example is plot_demo_more_plotting.py and shows all the display modes + using add_edges and add_contours on a display object.

I'd say 3 examples: the 5-liner you mention, to catch people in, as the
glass brain is a clear selling point of the package, the current simple
example, and the current full example. The 5-liner would be on the
front page, but it would link (in the docstring) to the other examples.
