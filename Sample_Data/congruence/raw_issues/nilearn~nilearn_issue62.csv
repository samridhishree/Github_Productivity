I didn't add the ""copy"" argument to check_niimg() though, because it would have led to an unused copy in most cases. In fact, the keyword has only an effect for no-op cases. When a resampling has to be performed for real, a copy in always made (this is by design and cannot be changed).

Code coverage is now 100% for nisl.resampling.

Of course, if the input niimg was a file name this copy is irrelevant. This is why I think that it is of high priority to add a ""copy"" keyword argument to check_niimg.
