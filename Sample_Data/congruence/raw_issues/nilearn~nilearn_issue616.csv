"issue_comment","616","nilearn","nilearn","lesteve","2015-06-24 13:45:20","As discussed with @salma1601 it looks like we need to add a resample_interpolation in the reorder_img call in add_edges.

The only question is whether resample_interpolation='continuous' makes sense for all cases, e.g. how likely is it to call add_edges with a label img (in which case resample_interpolation='nearest' would make sense)?
