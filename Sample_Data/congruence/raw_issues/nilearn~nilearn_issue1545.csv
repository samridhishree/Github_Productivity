- smoothing_fwhm=0. fails with ```scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter1d``` (see https://travis-ci.org/nilearn/nilearn/jobs/299711990#L3471). More details about this particular FIX is discussed in this issue #1537 
- Having more strict checks on the critical frequencies should be ```Digital filter critical frequencies must be 0 < Wn < 1``` with ```scipy.signal.butter``` rather should be btw 0 and 1. This FIX seems like a more reasonable approach to restrict to ```1 - 10 * np.finfo(1.).eps``` when given frequency is more than nyquist criteria.

Can I please have reviews ?","start issue","FIX: issues with recent SciPy"
