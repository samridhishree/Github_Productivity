"issue_comment","935","nilearn","nilearn","lesteve","2016-01-08 13:23:28","From a quick glance at it, LGTM.

A few comments:
- the issue was talking about moving around the examples but you moved also some of the documentation, e.g. plotting.rst got moved from doc/manipulating_visualizing to doc/plotting manipulating_images.rst got moved from doc/manipulating_visualizing to manipulating_images. Not sure whether the generated HTML looks any different. If it doesn't that's probably fine.
- Someone should double-check once CircleCI that the breakdown of the examples by category makes sense. In particular what went into the ""Advanced"" section. Here is a comment from @GaelVaroquaux from the associated issue in case it helps:

> Advanced is just another word for 'other', in a certain sense. We would put things like the low-level ICA stuff, or the mass-univariate stuff. Ie things that we don't really want to advertise strong to end users.

I would like to change the ordering of the examples in the documentation. For this I suggest renaming the directors from ""foobar"" to ""01_foobar"".

The ordering that I would like is:

- 03_connectivity

Correct for the first part, but don't remove tune_toc.rst, as it's used
elsewhere.
