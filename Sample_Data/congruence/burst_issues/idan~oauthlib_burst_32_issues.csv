I think blinker can be pretty neat for monitoring / debugging / testing and
don't mind it too much since we can default to not installing it (falling
back on the no-op) and users who want it can install extra packages.

I'm not sure I see how it would fit into a normal client work flow without
being awkward. I think making the token a dict subclass with a
scope_changed boolean property might be neater.

```
client = BackendApplicationClient(...)
token = client.fetch_token(...)
if token.scope_changed:
     # uh oh we need to disable some features
     for scope in token.scopes:
           enable_feature_for_scope(scope)
     for scope in token.unauthorized_scopes:
           disable_feature_for_scope(scope)
```

The benefit of callbacks would be not having to check for scoped_changed
but not sure how big a win that is. Maybe I'm missing something...

Previously (as with your PR) it only triggers when the supplied token type
is valid but not supported. Now its if its invalid or unsupported which I
feel make more sense and aligns closer to the description

unsupported_token_type:  The authorization server does not support
           the revocation of the presented token type.  That is, the
           client tried to revoke an access token on a server not
           supporting this feature.

I'd be happy to hear your thoughts :)

Could do, though as you mentioned earlier that would break backward-compatibility.

I don't think a `warnings.warn()` is sufficient. The purpose here is to signal to the application that scope has changed, so the application can respond accordingly (by reasking for the denied permission, or downgrading the experience, or ...). The more I think about it, the more it seems like making this a per-call configuration is better than an envvar. I can easily imagine an application that wants to ignore scope changes in some contexts but not in others. The onus is then on #268 as to why an envvar is appropriate there instead of yet another parameter.

I'm skeptical that this needs to be a per-call configuration: if the application wants to ignore scope changes in some contexts but not others, the application can easily enable this exception (or whatever solution we end up with), and just take action when necessary:

``` python
try:
    parse_token_response(token_response)

So if I understand this right the problem is that since raising a Warning interrupts the flow the token is never returned. On top of my head there are a few approaches here
1. Not raising but merely logging/warning. This is awkward to ""catch"".
2. Transporting the token on the warning itself. This assumes no other modification/checking is done and complicates the logical flow.
3. Returning the warning/differing scope/etc a long with the token. Breaks current API.
4. Adding more parameters to the token like (oauthlib_)scope_changed (boolean) and (oauthlib_)old_scope. No change in flow and user would check the token items rather than catching a warning.
5. Similar to 4 but rather create a Token class (extending dict) which could have properties such as scope_changed.
6. Introduce a signalling system. Think this is a bit overkill here but maybe worth it in the long run, will have to look into signals and how they might fit a bit more.

I'm currently leaning towards 5. Thoughts?
