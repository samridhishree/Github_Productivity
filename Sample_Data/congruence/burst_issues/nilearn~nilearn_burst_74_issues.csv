Second, in terms of avoiding user error, I think that one think that we could do is that if len(os.path.split(dirname)) > 1, we should check if the base directory exists. If it doesn't exist, we should bail out, and give a very explicit error message.

I disagree: what if a user (ie windows user) has a '~' in a directory
name. That user will be very very surprised, and will not understand

There is no globbing/expansion logic in joblib. I don't want to add any.

Reading the [doc](https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.path.html#os.path.expanduser), only initial `~` is taken in to account. On windows, `~` might be used by the system at the end of long paths. It will be fine.

Agreed. However, as a Windows developper, I will never ever try to use `~` to reach home, my first reflex (if I am agnostic to Python path policy) would be to use `%UserProfile%`. In that case, `expandvars` is far more important than `expanduser`.

Given that this cross-platform case is very poorly handled by Python, I agree with Gael to the fact that we should let the user find its own path (how poetic).
