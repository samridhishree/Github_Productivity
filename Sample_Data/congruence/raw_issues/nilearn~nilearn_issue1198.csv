It's a change in scipy 0.18 (I am a bit unhappy about that):
https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/1199

Working on fixing that. Give me another hour.

It seems to me that gen_rst.py got out of sync with sphinx-gallery master. I'll fix that.

Missing images generally are a symptom of an error in an example. Looking at the first failure in master (https://circleci.com/gh/nilearn/nilearn/1880), the root problem seems to be:

```

This would be good indeed to remove the `grep Traceback` as a way to make sure that no examples has failed.
