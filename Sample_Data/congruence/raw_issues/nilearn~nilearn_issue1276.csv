The warning should be added at the end of compute_epi_mask, compute_multi_epi_mask, compute_background_mask, compute_multi_background_mask.

The warning should be explicit that ""Automatic mask computation has failed on image %s"". It should provide common problems and their solutions for instance: using compute_epi on images that are not EPI, or vice versa, or using compute_epi on images that were detrended, centered or variance normalized.
