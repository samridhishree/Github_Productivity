It may be problematic to use this argument by default, rather than ```interpolation=""nearest""```, because we have often observed ringing artefacts in the resampled images.

"issue_comment","1417","nilearn","nilearn","GaelVaroquaux","2017-03-21 12:54:22","I disagree with your conclusions. The way it is currently done in the
maskers is that ""nearest"" is used for masks and labels, and ""continuous""
for the rest.

Yes there will be ringing. But what makes you think that ringing is more
a problem than the artifacts that nearest neighbor interpolation will
create? By standard considerations of signal processing, it should be
less a problem.
