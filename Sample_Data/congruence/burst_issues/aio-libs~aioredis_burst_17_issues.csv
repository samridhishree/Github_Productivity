2,issue_comment,123,aio-libs,aioredis,ushuz,2016-05-13 07:17:18,"`aioredis` is a general purpose Redis driver / connector, while queue is a specific purpose application. Queue is not what a driver needs to do its job, so I think it shouldn't be included in `aioredis`.

3,issue_comment,123,aio-libs,aioredis,shicky,2016-05-16 01:31:03,"Perhaps you are right.
But I still think it is common use-case for Redis and wouldn't hurt to be included.

4,issue_comment,123,aio-libs,aioredis,popravich,2016-05-25 15:05:56,"Hi guys,
I agree with ushuz that such `Queue` should not be included in `aioredis`,
because its hard to satisfy everybodys needs: someone may want Queue based on lists
someone may want it based on sorted sets, someone may want it to be built with some other concept.

Anyway, you can publish you Queue implementation on pypi and give me a link to be included in docs.
I think it would be really helpful for lib users to see a list with such extensions.

Could you please provide some feedback on current implementation?

the main idea is ok -- ""check if list is not full and then add one item"",
but implementation would not work this way as between list size check and data append command
list may change in redis, consider this timeline:

```
coro1: -- llen() ---------- rpush(data) ----->
coro2: ---------- llen() --------------- rpush(data) --->
```

So the best way to implement constrained queue would be to use Lua scripting.
Redis executes lua-script as single command so you can check the len and add (or not add) data
to list atomically.
