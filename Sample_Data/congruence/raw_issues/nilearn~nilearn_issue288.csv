They look ok to me. The title hiding the L/R labels is something which is outside the scope of this PR I would say.

When comparing the two plots, note that there is a left-right inversion for some reason.

I guess one of the possible complaint is that `plot_stat_map` insists on having a symmetrical colormap around zero (as was already noted by @eickenberg and @mrahim) which doesn't really make sense in this case.

"issue_comment","288","nilearn","nilearn","eickenberg","2014-11-24 09:48:23","Slightly off topic, but the reason for which I was tagged: After discussing with @GaelVaroquaux the THM were the following:
- `plot_stat_map` is designed to plot statistical maps and plot them nicely, with useful defaults.
- Anybody who wants to do anything that differs from what is proposed in `plot_stat_map` should use `plot_img`
- An enhancement of `plot_stat_map` would be to add a keyword argument `symmetric_range=True`, which if specified to `False` will make the colorbar go from 0 to the positives.

Since there are many subtleties to discuss, I'd propose a separate PR. I'll set it up quickly.
