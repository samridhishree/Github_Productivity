Coverage decreased (-0.2%) to 92.272% when pulling **f61321eaff770e1520c317df750750eed3307bda on shicky:redis_queue** into **3d97b83019b122288d7d2f561993ca6f907c6a47 on aio-libs:master**.

"pull_request_commit_comment","125","aio-libs","aioredis","popravich","2016-05-30 10:44:40","`put()` and `put_nowait()` methods are the main problem:
the main idea is ok -- ""check if list is not full and then add one item"",
but implementation would not work this way as between list size check and data append command
list may change in redis, consider this timeline:

```
coro1: -- llen() ---------- rpush(data) ----->
coro2: ---------- llen() --------------- rpush(data) --->
```

So the best way to implement constrained queue would be to use Lua scripting.
Redis executes lua-script as single command so you can check the len and add (or not add) data
to list atomically.

"pull_request_commit_comment","125","aio-libs","aioredis","popravich","2016-05-30 10:49:40","Having both `put` and `put_nowait` mean that first one must block until data is actually added to list (when it has space), however it wont happen, there should be a loop wating until list `is not full()`, then adding data to it and returning True.

"pull_request_commit_comment","125","aio-libs","aioredis","popravich","2016-05-30 10:55:13","Having such default value for key is **totally wrong**.
If someone using this Queue will not specify `key` parameter he will end up working with different queues every time application restarts.
key argument must not have default value.

Are you suggesting that it would be better to use lua script to implement this and wrap it with python using lupa?
