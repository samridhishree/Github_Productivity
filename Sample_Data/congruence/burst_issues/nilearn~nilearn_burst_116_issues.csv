```python
from nilearn import datasets, plotting

n_subjects = 1
localizer_path = datasets.fetch_localizer_contrasts(
    ['calculation (auditory cue)'], n_subjects=n_subjects, get_tmaps=True)
tmap_filename = localizer_path.tmaps[0]

plotting.plot_stat_map(tmap_filename, threshold=None)
```
According to doc threshold=None implies not thresholding an image which is good. But, we are not eliminating any numerical noise here.

Shall I go for a PR to fix this ?
I would add small threshold = 1e-6 in helper function ```_plot_img_with_bg``` in nilearn.plotting.img_plotting.py",start issue,Few plotting functions not removes background with threshold=None

Sorry if I misunderstood your point.",,

So, I don't see the reason to change the behavior of the function.",,

Noise which represents background. See for instance the doc [at line 660](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/nilearn/plotting/img_plotting.py#L660)
plotting will look like this.

This issue is concerned to any map. I have my own maps which looks like this.",,
