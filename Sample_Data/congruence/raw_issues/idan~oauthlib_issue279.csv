"issue_comment","279","idan","oauthlib","ib-lundgren","2014-10-16 08:53:00","I'm a bit torn regarding when to use the unsupported token type error.

Previously (as with your PR) it only triggers when the supplied token type
is valid but not supported. Now its if its invalid or unsupported which I
feel make more sense and aligns closer to the description

unsupported_token_type:  The authorization server does not support
           the revocation of the presented token type.  That is, the
           client tried to revoke an access token on a server not
           supporting this feature.

I'd be happy to hear your thoughts :)

Invalid token_type_hints should be ignored. This looks to have been
