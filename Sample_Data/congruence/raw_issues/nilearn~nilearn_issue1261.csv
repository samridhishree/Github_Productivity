I would like to submit a PR adding a style-consistent notice of package availability [where neuro/debian/ubuntu are also mentioned](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/doc/install_doc_component.html).
However, I don't know how to preview that web page. 
`google-chrome-stable doc/install_doc_component.html` perhaps predictably ignores all styling.
