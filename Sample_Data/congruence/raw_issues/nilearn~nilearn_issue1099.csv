They seem to be very far apart - spanning up to five orders of magnitude, whereas my tstat data is mainly between +30 and -30. I know how to set the boundaries manually, but would it not be better if this could be auto-set (similarly to the `threshold` argument)?

In case this feature doesn't exist (yet) - does nilearn have any simple way of displaying the maximum and minimum voxel values? or better yet, return all voxel values as a 1d array?

They are chosen as the max of the absolute value of data.

I would use nibabel for that.

Not convinced: it expects to return an image.

I got a bold image in normalize MNI space (2mm) when I try to plot the seed correlation from PCC as in the example (http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_seed_to_voxel_correlation.html) 
I got pixels outside the brain figure.
thanks!

You could do something like this to mask out of brain. This is just an idea not necessary that you should use this mask (icbm below).
```python
from nilearn import datasets
from nilearn.input_data import NiftiMasker

icbms = datasets.fetch_icbm152_2009()
masker = NiftiMasker(mask_img=icbms.mask)

data = masker.fit_transform('sbc_z.nii.gz')
masked_sbc_z_img = masker.inverse_transform(data)

display = plotting.plot_stat_map(masked_sbc_z_img,
                                 threshold=0.3, dim='auto',
                                 display_mode='x')
```
Hope this helps.","",""
