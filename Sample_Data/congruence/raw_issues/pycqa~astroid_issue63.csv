We should add support for six.moves in astroid.brain. Running Pylint over a codebase which uses a lot of six.moves modules yields too many no-name-in-module. Here's how six.moves add its attributes:

```
#!python

for attr in _moved_attributes:
    setattr(_MovedItems, attr.name, attr)
    if isinstance(attr, MovedModule):
        _importer._add_module(attr, ""moves."" + attr.name)
del attr

_MovedItems._moved_attributes = _moved_attributes

moves = _MovedItems(__name__ + "".moves"")
```
