We could understand **missing**: when a key is not found in a dictionary, if it provides the dunder missing special method, then that method will be called and whatever is returned, will be the result of key access:

```
#!python

class A(dict):
   def __missing__(self, key): return 42

a = A()
print(a[10])
```
