"issue_comment","916","nilearn","nilearn","pbellec","2015-12-16 14:46:12","Thanks @GaelVaroquaux for opening this issue. I had a look at what's involved. Looks like it needs
1. a description file urchs_2015.rst under datasets/description
2. the code to actually download the dataset should be added in datasets/atlas.py
3. a test to check the integrity of the download should be added in tests/test_atlas.py

Can you please confirm I am not missing anything? I can certainly draft (1). Could give a shot at (2) and (3) by adapting code for other templates, let me know what you think.
