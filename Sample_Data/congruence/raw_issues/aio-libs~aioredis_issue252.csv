There's a new version of [pytest](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest) available.
You are currently using **3.1.0**. I have updated it to **3.1.2**

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.1.2

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Required options added via ``pytest_addoption`` will no longer prevent using
>  --help without passing them. (1999)

>- Respect ``python_files`` in assertion rewriting. (2121)

>- Fix recursion error detection when frames in the traceback contain objects
>  that can&#39;t be compared (like ``numpy`` arrays). (2459)

>- ``UnicodeWarning`` is issued from the internal pytest warnings plugin only
>  when the message contains non-ascii unicode (Python 2 only). (2463)

>- Added a workaround for Python 3.6 WindowsConsoleIO breaking due to Pytests&#39;s
>  FDCapture. Other code using console handles might still be affected by the
>  very same issue and might require further workarounds/fixes, i.e. colorama.
>  (2467)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Fix internal API links to ``pluggy`` objects. (2331)

>- Make it clear that ``pytest.xfail`` stops test execution at the calling point
>  and improve overall flow of the ``skipping`` docs. (810)




>### 3.1.1

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- pytest warning capture no longer overrides existing warning filters. The
>  previous behaviour would override all filters and caused regressions in test
>  suites which configure warning filters to match their needs. Note that as a
>  side-effect of this is that ``DeprecationWarning`` and
>  ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` are no longer shown by default. (2430)

>- Fix issue with non-ascii contents in doctest text files. (2434)

>- Fix encoding errors for unicode warnings in Python 2. (2436)

>- ``pytest.deprecated_call`` now captures ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` in
>  context manager form. (2441)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Addition of towncrier for changelog management. (2390)
