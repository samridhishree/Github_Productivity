The current value for max fails in a row is 10 but this is far too optimistic; it's actually likely to find 10 bad images in a row (in the cases I've seen, it's metadata referencing files that don't exist). I suggest we allow 500 failures instead.","start issue","increase threshold for stopping dl in neurovault"
