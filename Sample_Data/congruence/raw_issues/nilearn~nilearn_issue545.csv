For example, it is a bit nasty that there is some code in displays.py to create the colorbar and that it is then modified in img_plotting.py in the case corresponding to positive only or negative only values in plot_stat_map. In this case you only keep half of the colorbar (upper/lower for positive/negative only values).

A first thing to try to would be to create the ""halved"" colorbar in plot_stat_map and pass it to _plot_img_with_bg. The colorbar halving logic could go to plotting/cm.py if that works.

Another way to do it would be to have some kind of colorbar factory that takes care of the threshold graying and colorbar halving.
