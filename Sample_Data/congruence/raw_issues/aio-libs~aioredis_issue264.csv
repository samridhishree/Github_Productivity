"issue_comment","264","aio-libs","aioredis","thomasst","2017-07-17 15:25:31","Just pushed some fixes. I also wanted to get your opinion on the return value of `ping()`. Normally it returns the string ""PONG"" (which Redis returns). However, in pubsub mode is returns a (lower case) ""pong"" message, so for consistency reasons I chose to return the ""PONG"" string. We might also want to consider returning nothing or True (the regular Python Redis library returns True). What do you think?","",""
