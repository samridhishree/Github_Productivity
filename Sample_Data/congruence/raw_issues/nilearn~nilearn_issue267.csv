Also I think it would be better to raise a ValueError rather than an AttributeError to be consistent with what the NiftiMasker is doing. I would even use the same error message:

``` python
raise ValueError('It seems that %s has not been fit. '
                             'You must call fit() before calling transform().'
                             % self.__class__.__name__)
