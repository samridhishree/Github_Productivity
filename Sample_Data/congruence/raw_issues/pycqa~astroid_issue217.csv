At the moment, there are no tests to call module_build() or inspect_build() with a path value that's not None.  Since module_build() is only called on builtin modules and `__file__` is never set for builtins, the first getattr always evaluates to None.

``` python
    def module_build(self, module, modname=None):
        """"""Build an astroid from a living module instance.""""""
        node = None
        path = getattr(module, '__file__', None)
        if path is not None:
            path_, ext = os.path.splitext(modutils._path_from_filename(path))
            if ext in ('.py', '.pyc', '.pyo') and os.path.exists(path_ + '.py'):
                node = self.file_build(path_ + '.py', modname)
        if node is None:
            # this is a built-in module
            # get a partial representation by introspection
            node = self.inspect_build(module, modname=modname, path=path)
```

The only call to inspect_build() with a path argument at all is in module_build().

For the record, it is expected that the first `if` branch is not taken for builtin modules, while it is actually taken for modules written in Python. This needs a test for a builtin module such as sys and for a module in Python, such as collections.
