Given the following code, astroid and pylint fails with a RuntimeError, since the patching from test is taken in consideration.

```
#!python

import string
Template = string.Template

class A(Template):
    pass

class B(A):
    pass

def test(x=False):
    if x:
        string.Template = A
    else:
        string.Template = B
```
