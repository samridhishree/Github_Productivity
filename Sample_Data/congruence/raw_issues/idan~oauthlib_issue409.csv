I am not sure that what I'm seeing is a bug or the intended behaviour. In `common.py`, `class Request`, line 380:
`self.headers = CaseInsensitiveDict(encode(headers or {}))`
The headers are parsed into a `CaseInsensitiveDict`, which means `self.headers['content-type']`, `self.headers['Content-Type']` and `self.headers['cONteNt-tYpE']` will all return the same value BUT the keys of the dictionary are still the ones with which the items were defined.

Line 386, all the `_params` are set to None, with full lower case keys. 

Then line 406 
`self._params.update(self.headers)`
So if some `_params` were set in the headers they should update the values here. Problem is, the headers all have first-letter capitalization. So passing a token through header will lead to have 

```
self._params
    {""token"": None, ""Token"": token_value}

request.token
    None
```

Is this the intended behaviour ? I guess not.
