As a result, the example is less striking, but this should be improved with the use of, say, RPBI (upcoming PR).

However, the current state of this example is that it is too technical
for anybody that is not an expert. I am afraid that there isn't much that
we can do about, but it is certainly not something that we can show
without risking freaking out newcomers to the Python neuroimaging world.

We'll have to do this, but later, because it means have subdirectories.
Right now the examples are in the root folder, because when people
download the package it runs out of the box without installation.

When we close in on an alpha release (this summer?), we will do that.
