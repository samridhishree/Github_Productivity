At the moment, the brain tests only try to import the stdlib version of enum:

``` python
try:
    import enum # pylint: disable=unused-import
    HAS_ENUM = True
except ImportError:
    HAS_ENUM = False
```

This should be extended to include the backport for earlier Python versions, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/enum34.
