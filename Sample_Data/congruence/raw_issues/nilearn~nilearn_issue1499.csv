Then I ran this:
mask = compute_epi_mask(data)
got the following error, but with the change of int8 to int16, I can get rid of the error.

never experienced the problem, and I work with nifti).

Could you please:

1. Adjust the code to do use int16 only for analyze

2. Write a unit test

One is in nilearn, the other in nibabel (different package, with
different set of contributors), so it's a very different fix.

I cannot speak for nibabel.

I don't believe that this is in the nilearn codebase, but in the nibabel
codebase. And I cannot assess it's correctness, as I don't know nibabel
well enough.
