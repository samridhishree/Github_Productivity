They definitely should not be _installed_ (setup.py install), since that causes a weird ""tests"" package to be copied in to the python sitedir. If multiple python projects were to do this, you would end up with files clobbering each other, as in the bug report below.

yes I'm perfectly fine with solution proposed by floppym: tests should not be installed, only shipped in the source tarball.

In general, I do support including the tests in the source tarball, and in the
distro package.  The key thing of course, is that the tests should live in a
subpackage of the main package, e.g. oauthlib.tests, so there's no namespace
pollution.  Ideally then `pythonX setup.py test` or `pythonX -m unittest
discover` would run all the tests.

Is the general consensus that it would be better to have tests as a subpackage instead? If so then I'll move them there before next push.

I don't know if you _can_ get general consensus ;) but I do prefer them as a
subpackage.  For downstream consumers, it's easy enough to include them and
run the tests, or remove them from distro packaging.  As I mentioned though, I
personally prefer to include them since they can provide assurances for the
ultimate user (who can usually run the tests locally if necessary, e.g. to
debug any local failures they might see), and often useful examples of how to
use the library.

TL;DR: +1 for including them in a subpackage.

If it is moved to a subpackage, just make sure that they are kept working and function in all supported versions of python. Installing broken code on the end-user's system is never good.
