Given the following code, it will print YES instead of the HTTPConnection class. That's because we can't handle the `from six.moves import ..`, due to the fact that there's no six.moves module.

```
#!python

from astroid.test_utils import extract_node
n = extract_node('''
from six.moves import http_client
http_client = six.moves.http_client
http_client.HTTPConnection #@
''')
print(n.infered())
```

This works fine:

```
#!python

from astroid.test_utils import extract_node
n = extract_node('''
import six
http_client = six.moves.http_client
http_client.HTTPConnection #@
''')
print(n.infered())
```

Improve the inference of six.moves.

This patch improves especially the inferrence when using `from ... import ...`
syntax. Also, we added a new fail import hook for six.moves, which fixes the
import-error false positive from pylint. Closes issue #107.
