This prevents authentication with services such as Slack which require the token in the URI and for it to be called 'token', not 'access_token'. (https://api.slack.com/web#authentication)

We can make it configurable somehow though.
Any suggestions?

"issue_comment","395","idan","oauthlib","Kylotan","2016-05-08 15:01:47","No, sorry. I don't understand OAuth or the library well enough to comment or suggest a solution. All I know is that I have to extract the token from the OAuth2Session and pass it back as a parameter when accessing the Slack API. If you're sure this is against the spec then maybe someone should contact Slack with reference to that spec and see if they'll change it.
