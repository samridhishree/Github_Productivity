I am just researching something else but wanted to consume this lib, getting this error.

AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'auth1'

This is my code.

---

import oauthlib

url =  ""http://mysite.com""
consumerKey =    ""xyz""
consumerSecret = ""abc""

def get_request():
    print(method)
    client = oauthlib.oauth1.Client(consumerKey , client_secret = consumerSecret)
        uri, headers, body = client.sign(url)
    return headers
# end get_request

headers = get_request()
print(headers) 

---

Please suggest, thanks in advance.

Regards,
Anurag
