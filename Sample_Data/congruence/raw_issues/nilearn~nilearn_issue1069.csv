```
from nilearn import datasets
from nilearn.input_data import NiftiLabelsMasker,NiftiMasker

data = datasets.fetch_adhd(n_subjects=40)
atlas = datasets.fetch_atlas_aal()
atlas_filename = atlas.regions

masker = NiftiLabelsMasker(labels_img= atlas_filename, standardize=True,resampling_target='labels')
adhd_0 = masker.fit_transform(data.func[0], confounds=data.confounds[0])

print masker.mask_img
```

It is strange that the mask_img is still None after I done this. Any Idea?

Also, how can I get the mask_img which tells me which voxels are kept to form the final signal generated by the makser?

NiftiLabelsMasker stores the label atlas in `labels_img_`. The `mask_img`parameter can be used to exclude voxels outside of the Brain. Meaning that if zone r√©gion from the labels has a part inside of the Braun and one outside (as defined by mask_img) then the mean of the voxels inside the brain is averaged at transform.
