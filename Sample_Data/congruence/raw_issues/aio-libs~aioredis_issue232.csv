With `-bb` the warnings turn into exceptions and I can't even run my code :(","start issue","BytesWarning: Comparison between bytes and string"
"issue_comment","232","aio-libs","aioredis","popravich","2017-05-18 07:16:35","So? Why would you need to run your code with `-b` or `-bb`?
I'm sorry, I just don't follow your concern. This is intended behavior â€” `command` is expected to be either
`str` or `bytes` instance and I don't want to do repeat same checkes/encoding.","",""
"issue_comment","232","aio-libs","aioredis","gjcarneiro","2017-05-18 09:48:49","Say I want to check my own code for errors about mixing bytes and str.  I turn on `-b`.  Now I am  spammed  by warnings from aioredis.  If I run with `-bb` to make sure no unicode bugs creep up in production, I get crashes from aioredis.

It's kind of a ""code smell"" that `command` can be either str or bytes, imho.  You should just pick one and stick with it.","",""
