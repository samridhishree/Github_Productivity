#640. The contribution is to add a fetcher for downloading selected

images from http://neurovault.org/. I have tried to address some of
the remarks that were made in the discussion about #832. I have
included the examples `plot_ica_neurovault.py` and
`plot_neurovault_meta_analysis.py` from the previous PR; they remain
almost identical.

The interface to the fetcher is similar to that proposed in #832. I
have kept the possibility to filter collections and images either with
a function or with a dictionary of `{field: desired_value}` pairs (or
both), but they are now separate arguments called respectively
`collection_filter` (`image_filter` for images) and `collection_terms`
(`image_terms` for images). Also, now the filters passed in a
dictionary are only inserted in the query URL if they are actually
available on the server (which is the case for the collection owner,
the collection DOI, and the collection name); otherwise they are
applied to the metadata once it has been downloaded.

For users who want a specific set of image or collection ids,
downloading all the Neurovault metadata and filtering on the ids is
inefficient; so they can use the `image_ids` or `collection_ids`
parameters to pass the lists of ids they want to download; in this
case any filter is ignored and the server is queried directly for the
required image and collection ids. Note: this is also done under the
hood if the collection id is used as a filter term - either by
specifying the collection 'id' field or the image 'collection_id'
field - except that in this case the other filters are still applied.

I have included a `ResultFilter` class and a bunch of special values
such as `NotNull` which can be used to specify filters more easily. In
some neurovault metadata jsons, some values are strings such as """",
""null"", ""None""... instead of actual `null`; these (more precisely
strings that match `($|n/?a$|none|null)` in a case-insensitive way)
are replaced by a true null value (`null` in the json, converted to
`None` when loaded in a python dict) upon download so that comparing
to `None` or testing for truth should yield the expected results.  In
particular `dict.get(field)` will give the same value wether the
original value was `null`, ""null"", ... , or plain missing.

This should make using `fetch_neurovault` somewhat easier. However,
for users who are interested in a large subset of the neurovault data
and are not too short on disk space, I would recommend using only very
simple filters (e.g. the defaults) when calling `fetch_neurovault` to
download (almost all) the data, and, once it is on disk, only access
it through `read_sql_query`, `local_database_connection` or
`local_database_cursor`. The metadata is stored in an sqlite database,
so instead of having to read the docstring for `fetch_neurovault`,
writing their own filters, etc., most users will probably prefer to
download it all and then simply use SQL syntax to select the subset
they're interested in. `read_sql_query` queries the database and
returns the result as an `OrderedDict` of columns (the default) or as
a list of rows. `local_database_connection` gives a connection to the
sqlite file, so that pandas users can load e.g., all the images'
metadata by typing:

```
images = pandas.read_sql_query(
     ""SELECT * FROM images"", neurovault.local_database_connection())

It would be good. I have no love for the logging framework in Python, as
it is quite poor to give user information (such as progress), which is
really what we want to do when we use ""print"".

Maybe we need an internal data-download function that downloads multiple

First it prints thing that are incomprehensible to the user (like the
module name and the warning type). That tends to clutter the display and
scare people. Second, indeed, it is not great for displaying progress.

Maybe an optional progress bar, with estimation of the time. Ideally, we

Thank you for this feedback! Could you send me the detail of the commands you typed when you had this problem?

I tried to reproduce it but for me, it took a couple of seconds to load the metadata for all images on disk, and half a minute to check for new images and update metadata:

Load metadata for all images on disk:

```
>>> %time data = nv.fetch_neurovault(mode='offline', max_images=None, image_terms={})
CPU times: user 1.15 s, sys: 174 ms, total: 1.32 s
Wall time: 1.32 s
>>> len(data['images'])
13522
```

update metadata and download images not yet on disk(in this case I already had them all, so no new image was downloaded):

```
>>> %time data = nv.fetch_neurovault(mode='download_new', max_images=None, image_terms={})
CPU times: user 5.84 s, sys: 1.12 s, total: 6.96 s
Wall time: 30.9 s
```

18,issue_comment,1182,nilearn,nilearn,bcipolli,2016-10-04 13:52:57,"```

        mode='download_new',
        max_images=5000, image_filter=image_filter,
        fetch_neurosynth_words=True)
```

It's almost 1 second per image. When I remove the `image_filter` arg, it seems to get higher faster, but still over ten minutes before I quit waiting.  Same if I set `fetch_neurosynth_words=False`.

Offline is quick.

More detailed info is displayed if the logging level is set to a lower value,

```
neurovault.set_logging_level(neurovault.logging.DEBUG)
```

I can make DEBUG the default logging level. I will add a `verbose` parameter in the function to control that as in the other nilearn functions.

The progress from `_chunk_report_` (the one with the 'seconds remaining' and the carriage return) is not displayed because the images have to be downloaded one by one and each takes around a second, so there wouldn't be much time to look at it anyway. If we want to have it, I can change the verbose parameter when calling `fetch_file` so that this report appears.

It will be more useful when we add a function that uses the new 'download_all' button from neurovault, but this hasn't been implemented yet.

Could you please provide the part of your script that loads the images? On my laptop it takes 7 seconds to load 7000 images and check metadata is up-to-date, using `mode='download_new'`. Maybe seeing what you did differently can help me find the performance bug in the new fetcher.

I'm not sure I have understood. by default logging output is dumped on stderr, so the user sees it on the console. Is the problem that log records will be printed on separate lines (and that we can't use carriage return as is done in `_chunk_report_`)?

The current behaviour is to use fetch_file to download each file and print how many images have been downloaded so far; what other information should we add?

I can set the formatter to print whatever we want; for now I have set it to print only the logging level  (but I agree it's not useful) and the message, I can change it to print only the message itself, or maybe also the time?

Then the best solution may be to replace all calls to the logging module by calls to print or `_chunk_report_`, does this seem better?

@bcipolli Sorry for the delay. This was indeed the behaviour, the motivation was this scenario:
- I download some images with a strict filter, which dowloads image 1 from collection 1 but filters out image 2 in collection 1
- later, I launch a download with a less restrictive filter, which would accept image 2. If the fetcher simply sees that we already have collection 1 and doesn't check that extra images are available by querying the server, collection_1/image_2 will be missing from the fetched images.

I have changed it to restore the faster behaviour you were expecting, so now it only checks for new collections. We could also try to update only the collections for which the number of images on disk is different from the number of images announced in the collection metadata
",,
24,issue_comment,1182,nilearn,nilearn,bcipolli,2016-11-14 15:24:34,"@jeromedockes Cool, thanks for the clarification.

In the old code, Scenario 2 would actually still fetch the image, It would use the locally cached collection metadata to list out the needed images (including image2), and the fetcher would determine that it's not cached locally, and so go fetch it. This is because the collection metadata was complete; no filtering within the metadata itself was done before caching locally.

The scenario where the old behavior would not get a new image is if an image is added to a collection remotely, after the metadata has been cached locally. I figured, since speed is such a factor, that scenario could be taken care of with an `--update-metadata` flag, outside the default behavior.

Perhaps I'm just misunderstanding your scenario 2, and it's just the scenario I described. :) Either way, thank you! I'll try re-integrating this latest code into our project, so we can help QA it.

Yes, the neurosynth results are saved on disk, but in the same folder as the image they describe rather than a separate neurosynth directory.

For me, once I turned on the debug logging, I got the level of output I had been accustomed to from `nilearn`. There were maybe one or two outputs that I didn't really need, but the rest were helpful in understanding the download progression of the fetcher.

It may be interesting to consider only these collections, but it would mean ignoring a lot of data:
if we consider all images which match the other filters:

| filter | # collections | # images |
| --- | --- | --- |
| all | 276 | 6803 |
| with DOI only | 109 | 5000 |

Moreover, I'm not sure having a DOI is such a good criterion: Out of 191 (non-empty) collections which have a DOI, 82 don't contain any image which passes the other default filters.

> Excluding parcellations and atlases might also make sense by default.

I have changed from keeping only T, Z and F maps to excluding images when:
- 'map_type' is one of 'ROI/mask', 'anatomical', 'parcellation'
- 'image_type' is 'atlas'

Just to remind us of what the 'map_type' and 'image_type' are

| map_type | image_type | n_images |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None | atlas | 18 |
| Chi squared map | statistic_map | 1 |
| F map | NIDM results statistic map | 2 |
| F map | statistic_map | 48 |
| P map (given null hypothesis) | statistic_map | 169 |
| ROI/mask | statistic_map | 286 |
| T map | NIDM results statistic map | 367 |
| T map | statistic_map | 1431 |
| Z map | NIDM results statistic map | 224 |
| Z map | statistic_map | 927 |
| anatomical | statistic_map | 22 |
| multivariate-beta map | statistic_map | 61 |
| other | statistic_map | 2822 |
| parcellation | statistic_map | 150 |
| univariate-beta map | statistic_map | 4288 |

> > Probably not by default, but we should make it really easy to perform
> > such selections.

For example, selecting only those with DOI can be done:

using `fetch_neurovault`:

```
>>> fetch_neurovault(collection_terms={'DOI': NotNull()})
```

using SQL:

```
>>> read_sql_query(""SELECT * FROM collections WHERE DOI IS NOT NULL"")
```

Actually I forked the branch directly from master, so the history wouldn't show any commits from @bcipolli (I wasn't clear in this PR's description, and should not have written 'this is based on...'). I have a branch in which I kept the full history, I can push it to github if you want to look at it. The examples were taken from PR #832 but the rest is completely different. Do you think it makes sense to rebase this branch on the one from PR #832?

Yes I do, I also already have a branch that adds it to the maskers.

Actually, the issue already exists #203 and some code to fix it also already exists #278. The problem is that if we enable it, we have to propagate everywhere. Meaning `compute_multi_epi_mask` should use it, `CanICA` should use it, etc.

Neurovault contains images in collections. Collections can be filtered via a few querystring arguments. Images to download and return should be limited by filters on collection and image metadata.

To do this, I've included `collection_filters` and `image_filters` arguments.
- If `isinstance(collection_filters, dict)`, the filters are used as querystring argument filters.
- If `isinstance(*_filters, collections.Iterable)` (i.e. a list), the filters are assumed to be functions that receive a collection or image metadata, and returns `True` if the collection's images should be queried, or if the image should be downloaded.

The function returns a `Bunch` of three:
- `collections`: a dict (key: collection_id) of collection metadata for matched collections.
- `images`: a list of image metadata (including local file paths) for matched & downloaded images.
- `func_files`: a list of paths to downloaded files. Could be removed, but I kept it as many other functions return a list of paths to images.

The example I've begun with is a `stop-go` task meta-analysis, ported from:

I think that the macanism of filters is too complicated for most of our users. We can keep it for advanced users but at some point we should provide simpler pre-made filters. For example, I think that a user should be able to specify the id of a collection or a list of ids (I know that it's possible through collection_filter). But we'll see that later.

Reproducing an example provided by neurovault is indeed the way to go.

Regardless of online or offline, there is an updating problem. When online, the code assumes that a cached copy of a particular collection or image metadata, or image data is correct / up-to-date. I have the `refresh` flag for controlling that behavior. A more automated mechanism is possible.

Separate from that, the code needs to work in offline mode; currently it does not. I have added that to the WIP item list.

Right; glad to add more simple filters. It's very easy to map from the simple filters to the more complex ones. The complex filters were needed to mirror the logic of the example I ported, but I could also change it to use specific collections and images (and tell users they were determined by searches on the website).

> So far, we have avoided this dependency but we may have to include it at some point. Is there a real benefit to use pandas here?

In the previous examples, the benefit was using Pandas' filtering mechanisms, which tend to lead to simpler code. But I just don't see it as an option here, unless we limit users to very simple filters (which I think would be a shame).

My main comment is that the examples are a bit scary. The fact that we come up with such examples suggests that we don't fully have the right abstractions. This is probably mostly unrelated with this PR (and something like https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/847 might help). However, the current examples are going against the will of nilearn to reassure users that things are simple and will be alright.

I seem to remember that it is fairly important to have the metric to
really be the Cramer-Rao metric.

That said, we could do it the other way around, and apply 1/sqrt(2) on
the diagonal, which would be probably more intuitive.

Oh, this... You must know about memory_level, right? Well, this function will decide if the caching is activated or not.

`func_memory_level` is the `threshold` from which the caching must be activated. `memory_level` is the level selected by the used. If `memory_level` is above `func_memory_level` (or the opposite, I always mix it up), then caching is activated, otherwise it is not.
