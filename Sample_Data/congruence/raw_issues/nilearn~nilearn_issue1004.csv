```
resample_img(img, target_affine=None, target_shape=None, interpolation='continuous', copy=True, order='F')
```

http://nilearn.github.io/modules/generated/nilearn.image.resample_img.html

It would be nice to have a variant

```
resample_to_img(source_img, target_img, interpolation='continuous', copy=True, order='F')
```

that would take the shape and affine from ""target_img"".

It's just a simple helper function, but it would make the life of many non advanced users simpler.

We should reference each function in there respective seealso section of the docstrings.
