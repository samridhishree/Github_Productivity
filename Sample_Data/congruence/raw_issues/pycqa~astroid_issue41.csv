The following is from Cole Robinson:

I poked at this a bit. Basically just doing:

```
#!python

diff --git a/brain/py2gi.py b/brain/py2gi.py
index 5001b7c..2584055 100644
--- a/brain/py2gi.py
+++ b/brain/py2gi.py

             modnames.append('gi._glib')
         elif modname == 'gi.repository.GObject':
             modnames.append('gi._gobject')

         try:
-            modcode = ''
-            for m in modnames:
-                __import__(m)
-                modcode += _gi_build_stub(sys.modules[m])

+                astng = MANAGER.ast_from_module(acmod, modname=m)
         except ImportError:
             astng = _inspected_modules[modname] = None
         else:
-            astng = AstroidBuilder(MANAGER).string_build(modcode, modname)
             _inspected_modules[modname] = astng

```

It didn't blow up, but running it against a simple script like:

from gi.repository import Gtk

print Gtk.get_major_version
print Gtk.get_major_version()

w = Gtk.Label()
w.set_label(""foo"")

Yielded these errors:

**\* Module pylint.testgtk E: 8, 0: Function 'wrapper' has no 'set_label' member (no-member) E: 8, 0: Instance of 'Label' has no 'set_label' member (no-member)

Unfortunately looking at the actual inspection code was overwhelming, so I don't think I can help here. I'm happy to test any work though, or help provide test cases.
