"pull_request_commit_comment","881","nilearn","nilearn","dohmatob","2015-12-03 13:48:34","Yes @danilo is right. So, shape `w_` should be documented as
- `(1, n_features + 1)` for two class classification problems (i.e `n_classes = 2`)
- `(n_classes, n_features + 1)` for `n_classes > 2`, and
- `(n_features,)` for regression

Document `coef_` as:
- `(1, n_features)` for two class classification problems (i.e `n_classes = 2`)
- `(n_classes, n_features)` for `n_classes > 2`, and
- `(n_features,)` for regression
