* The cortical outskirt is identical to the front view
* I changed the sulci and cerebellum using combination of  'nilearn/plotting/glass_brain_files/plot_align.svg' and the [following 3D rendering](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep43293?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618)
* I ran the json converter locally
* I changed the default 'y' direction to use the back view. 

Here is how it looks:

A subsequent PR could be made to have the option of using a mirror view which would make use of the front view, but this would require additional plotting parameters, and a bottom view.

"issue_comment","1486","nilearn","nilearn","bthirion","2017-07-26 19:28:53","Thx. I see 2 things in this PR:
* A fix of the inconsistency between brain anatomical projection and 'L' and 'R' tags
* A change of the default 'y' view fom front to back
While the first point is to be accepted, I am quite unsure about the second: this alters default behavior of the plotting routine. What do people think ?

"issue_comment","1486","nilearn","nilearn","kingjr","2017-07-27 00:05:34","@bthirion The behavior is unchanged. The 'y' direction was a back projection in the first place, but the drawing was a front projection, hence the mental incongruency. 

@GaelVaroquaux Here is how it looks after manually tweaking `direction_to_transform_params`
