For example, NetworkManager contains a class 80211ApFlags. Running pylint-1.1 on a file that contains

from gi.repository import NetworkManager

results in

Traceback (most recent call last):

    class 80211ApFlags(object):
              ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

The problem being that astroid attempts to generate python stubs for gi modules without checking whether the names are valid in python. Attaching a patch that fixes the problem by skipping such identifiers.

This patch should also remove the 'not name' and Iconv comment above, since it should catch that case as well.

David, I added your patch to a pull request against pylint-brain:

https://bitbucket.org/logilab/pylint-brain/pull-request/15/brain-couple-gobject-introspection-fixes/diff

However I can't close this bug...
