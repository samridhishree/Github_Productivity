I'm pinning it to the latest version **2.3.1** for now.
### Changelog

> ### 2.3.1
> ---
> - Fixed regression causing spurious errors when xdist was used. See `124
>   &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/124&gt;`_.
> - Fixed DeprecationWarning about incorrect `addoption` use. Contributed by Florian Bruhin in `PR127
>   &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/127&gt;`_.
> - Fixed deprecated use of funcarg fixture API. Contributed by Daniel Hahler in `PR125
>   &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/125&gt;`_.
> ### 2.3.0
> ---
> - Add support for specifying output location for html, xml, and annotate report.
>   Contributed by Patrick Lannigan in `PR113 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/113&gt;`_.
> - Fix bug hiding test failure when cov-fail-under failed.
> - For coverage &gt;= 4.0, match the default behaviour of `coverage report` and
>   error if coverage fails to find the source instead of just printing a warning.
>   Contributed by David Szotten in `PR116 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/116&gt;`_.
> - Fixed bug occurred when bare `--cov` parameter was used with xdist.
>   Contributed by Michael Elovskikh in `PR120 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/120&gt;`_.
> - Add support for `skip_covered` and added `--cov-report=term-skip-covered` command
>   line options. Contributed by Saurabh Kumar in `PR115 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/115&gt;`_.
> ### 2.2.1
> ---
> - Fixed incorrect merging of coverage data when xdist was used and coverage was `&gt;= 4.0`.
> ### 2.2.0
> ---
> - Added support for changing working directory in tests. Previously changing working
>   directory would disable coverage measurements in suprocesses.
> - Fixed broken handling for `--cov-report=annotate`.
> ### 2.1.0
> ---
> - Added support for `coverage 4.0b2`.
> - Added the `--cov-append` command line options. Contributed by Christian Ledermann
>   in `PR80 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/80&gt;`_.
> ### 2.0.0
> ---
> - Added `--cov-fail-under`, akin to the new `fail_under` option in `coverage-4.0`
>   (automatically activated if there&#39;s a `[report] fail_under = ...` in `.coveragerc`).
> - Changed `--cov-report=term` to automatically upgrade to `--cov-report=term-missing`
>   if there&#39;s `[run] show_missing = True` in `.coveragerc`.
> - Changed `--cov` so it can be used with no path argument (in wich case the source
>   settings from `.coveragerc` will be used instead).
> - Fixed `.pth` installation to work in all cases (install, easy_install, wheels, develop etc).
> - Fixed `.pth` uninstallation to work for wheel installs.
> - Support for coverage 4.0.
> - Data file suffixing changed to use coverage&#39;s `data_suffix=True` option (instead of the
>   custom suffixing).
> - Avoid warning about missing coverage data (just like `coverage.control.process_startup`).
> - Fixed a race condition when running with xdist (all the workers tried to combine the files).
>   It&#39;s possible that this issue is not present in `pytest-cov 1.8.X`.
> ### 1.8.2
> ---
> - N/A
