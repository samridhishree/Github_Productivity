We could infer what a list set or a dict comprehension returns when inferred, by using node.ilookup and creating a List / Set or Dict.

This can be useful for detecting bugs as these:

```
#!python

f = [i for i in [1, 2]]
print(f[0].lala) # int has no attribute lala
[i for i in range(1)][9] # oups index error
```

etc
