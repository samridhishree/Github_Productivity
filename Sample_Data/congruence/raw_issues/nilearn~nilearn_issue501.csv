For instance, maybe you are not performing 2-class classification with the SVM, but multiclass, and hence getting multiple return weight maps where you expect to be getting only one.

We are in the process of integraring it as it implies some changes in nilearn's core that are not trivial. I'll let you know when it's ready to use!

Sorry for the long wait. We have just merged a PR that should fix your problem. Could you try again and report us any error?

Thanks!
