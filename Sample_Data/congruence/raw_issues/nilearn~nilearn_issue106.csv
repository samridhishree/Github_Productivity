The second is just to add `doctools.js` to the themes/nilearn/static/ directory, in order to have the carousel be able to scroll pictures

This is a little fix for that behaviour

Thanks for patch. Philippe and me have done few changes to the CSS. Maybe we should make a branch for the last little details. We are not aware of all the choices made for the display so we want you to take a look at it. Can we discuss that tomorrow ?

"issue_comment","106","nilearn","nilearn","pgervais","2013-09-13 08:39:30","Since we're spending time on mobile devices support, it seems to me that using minified versions of the javascript files would be a good idea. It would reduce loading time, and leverage caching. Mobile devices usually have a policy of caching only very small files (http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/06/28/mobile-browser-cache-limits/). Even jQuery itself is probably too big.

@jaquesgrobler can you add the minified versions of jquery.js, doctools.js, etc.? (and use them in html, instead of the current versions). You may want to keep readable files as well (but not use them in html), that would help future debugging/understanding.

@AlexandreAbraham regarding the css changes that you and Philippe did,  shall we handle that on a separate branch?

Can I merge this patch in the meanwhile?
