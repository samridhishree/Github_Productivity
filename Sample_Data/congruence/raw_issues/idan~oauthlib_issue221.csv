"issue_title","221","idan","oauthlib","masci","2013-11-02 15:35:26","Some OAuth2 providers like Facebook support a response type which acts both as _Authorization code_ and _Implicit grant_[0] at the same time for a single Application. RFC 6749 permits the registration of new token types[1] and ""code token"" seems to be registered in this document[2].

I'm not sure whether this whole thing is strictly compliant to the standard or not, so I was wondering if there is any plan to add support for this token type to oauthlib.

Extension such as these are certainly planned for in the spec and I'd be happy to include it in oauthlib (if its a good spec, not very familiar with it, yet...). 

Unfortunately I'm terribly swamped for the foreseeable future and fear I won't be able to do much work on it myself. If you fancy taking a stab at it I'd be happy to help out as much as I find time to :)
