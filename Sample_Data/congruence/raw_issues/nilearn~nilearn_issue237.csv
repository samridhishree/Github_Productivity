The --pylab flag will be removed for IPython **notebook** on IPython 3.0 and is discouraged for other front-ends. Not sure about bog-standard IPython to be entirely fair, but I tend to agree with the general opinion that putting so many things in the main namespace (and shadowing builtins while we are at it like sum and all) is never a great idea.

On top of that I didn't look extensively but I could not find a place in the doc that actually relied on accessing functions that  --pylab puts in the main namespace.

OK, point taken.

It seems to sound better to my ears, but whatever the european parliement
says is good!

and confounding effects, such as a session effect, must be removed.

Is that good with you?
