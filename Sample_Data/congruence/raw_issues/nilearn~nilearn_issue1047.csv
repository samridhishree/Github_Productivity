Ideally, the top 2 plots should be contours of the the bottom-most one, but it looks like the implementations we have use completely different heuristics (disclaimer: i haven't yet looked at the code).

Finding default that work well on all inputs is hard. You can always
override defaults. But we tuned them on many maps, as you can see here:
http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/01_plotting/plot_prob_atlas.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-01-plotting-plot-prob-atlas-py

The challenge is to have a good behavior that looks OK for most input,
and not that looks great for one input! Remember that you can give an
explicit value for ""threshold"", and hence control the visualization you
achieve finely.

As long as the description is not longer than the code. Sometime, reading
the source is a good option.

Maybe (see below).

What does not thresholding means for filled_contours, or contours?

I don't say that we should use that by default, I just answer the question about how to plot contours with no thresholding.

Yes, you have choice to provide list of `threshold`s for each map if you want `contours` and `filled_contours` as your view_type.

I think yes it should be improved. I will try to take care of this doc improvement.

This concept works for continuous display I believe. But, I really don't know how to control levels without giving threshold (more or less acts like choosing levels) for contours and filled.
