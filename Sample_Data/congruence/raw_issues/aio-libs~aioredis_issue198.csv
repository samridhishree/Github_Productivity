I've checked [hiredis diff](https://github.com/redis/hiredis-py/compare/v0.2.0...HEAD) and its only few
minor changes so we can consider pypi version as ""fresh"").
Also I don't like running tests against unkown dependency version as it is possible that
two parallel build could run against different hiredis commits and it would be hard to replay such builds.","",""
