By default `dim=True` implies automatic dimming applies which makes contrast of the anatomical image weak. Some plotting functions are True and some are False by default. Any opinions on this ?

 Top one is dim=-1.5. Both are showing some change of effet actually.

No, not because of crash. We opened because we noticed no effect even given beyond upper bound. May be we haven't noticed the slight difference in the display.

Ok. I will keep all plotting to dim='auto' since all use MNI template except for plot_epi and plot_glass_brain ?
