"issue_comment","28","idan","oauthlib","ib-lundgren","2012-11-16 19:04:26","There are many things that would be useful to add as tests. On top of my head ...
- Tests serve as great documentation, show off the different signature methods with tests, i.e. rsa and plaintext.
- Requests with application/x-www-form-urlencoded, ensure it affects the signature
- Requests with non application/x-www-form-urlencoded, ensure it does not affect the signature. For examples see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME_type
- Possible run over a set of sample ""real"" requests with more complex combinations of query params, headers and body than the usual basic test.
- Similar to the above would be to generate possible combinations of combinations with nonsensical but valid data and see if there are odd edge cases.
