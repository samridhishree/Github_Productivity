I would take this as a NOTE in documentation near ```smoothing_fwhm``` and rather not add a test testing whether it raises an error.

I was trying to solve this ""zero-size array"" problem in PR #1247 by returning am empty array whenever there are no regions found to be extracted.

So, I am not sure whether we should add a test ?","82a3483d490923a471433d57e45fc585d0fae1d4","(None, '', u'nilearn/regions/tests/test_region_extractor.py')"
