:confused: what I am trying to get at is to leave the tests as they were, except for the shuffle which I think was a big flaw since it gave us false confidence that fast_abs_percentile was working when it wasn't.

Obviously you do need the 
`nose.tools.assert_equal, fast_abs_percentile(data, p), p`
rather than
`nose.tools.assert_equal, fast_abs_percentile(data, p - 1), p`

to get the tests to pass.
