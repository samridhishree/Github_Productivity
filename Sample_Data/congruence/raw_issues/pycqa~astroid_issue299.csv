"issue_title","299","pycqa","astroid","opalmer","2015-12-21 15:49:25","For some reason this code throws `assignment-from-no-return` on line 7 in Python 3.3:

``` python
""""""
Test module
""""""

from pkg_resources import resource_filename

PATH = resource_filename(""foo"", ""bar.py"")
```

I ran the above inside a clean virtual environment:

``` console
$ python3 --version
Python 3.4.3
$ virtualenv -p python3 /tmp/test
$ . /tmp/test/bin/activate
$ pip install pylint
$ pip freeze
astroid==1.4.2
colorama==0.3.5
lazy-object-proxy==1.2.1
pylint==1.5.2
six==1.10.0
wrapt==1.10.6
$ pylint -E test.py
No config file found, using default configuration
************* Module test
E:  7, 0: Assigning to function call which doesn't return (assignment-from-no-return)
```

For comparison with where I saw this problem originally, here's some of my code which up until yesterday didn't have problems:

https://github.com/opalmer/pywincffi/pull/33/files#diff-899a2c24db5c88e486a990d2702cf6c3R55

And here's the build on Travis which failed (prior to adding `disable=...`): https://travis-ci.org/opalmer/pywincffi/jobs/98052778

Here's the same code, but passing: https://travis-ci.org/opalmer/pywincffi/jobs/97980009

Based on the install output from line 97 downwards the above build used pylint 1.5.1 and astroid 1.4.1.  I thought this might be an issue with pylint but downgrading astroid to 1.4.1 seems to fix the issue:

``` console
$ pip install --upgrade astroid
...
Installing collected packages: astroid
  Found existing installation: astroid 1.4.1
    Uninstalling astroid-1.4.1:
      Successfully uninstalled astroid-1.4.1
Successfully installed astroid-1.4.2
$ pylint -E test.py
No config file found, using default configuration
************* Module test
E:  7, 0: Assigning to function call which doesn't return (assignment-from-no-return)
```

This appears to be a regression, but I'm not intimately familiar enought with either pylint or astroid enough to tell.  Could someone take a look?  I'd be happy to provide more detailed information too.

**UPDATE**: I rolled back astroid to 1.4.1 and kept pylint at the latest version, 1.5.2, and the build for  https://github.com/opalmer/pywincffi/compare/e85f28af3f6d...c6056b17ecf4, seems to pass: https://travis-ci.org/opalmer/pywincffi/builds/98140615
