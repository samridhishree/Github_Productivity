```
def test_namedtuple_instance_attrs(self):
    result = builder.extract_node('''
    from collections import namedtuple
    namedtuple('a', 'def class', rename=True)(1, 2) #@
    ''')
    inferred = next(result.infer())
    for name, attr in inferred.instance_attrs.items():
        self.assertEqual(attr[0].attrname, name)
```
### Current behavior

Test passed.
### Expected behavior

Test fails, since created tuple has renamed fields.

```
>>> from collections import namedtuple
>>> namedtuple('a', 'def class', rename=True)(1, 2)
a(_0=1, _1=2)
```

Astroid version: repository tip.
