as the title suggests, are you sure about this dependency? should it be a >= instead of <= ?

Initially yes, because 1.0 had a couple of fixes that were incompatible with 1.3.8. But since we dropped the use of logilab-common a few days ago, I'll backport that instead and we'll get rid of these inconsistencies.

I just released 1.3.8. I didn't get rid of logilab-common in this release, since backporting the removal from the default branch isn't enough, being necessary an additional pylint release. Anyway, the dependency is fixed now to >=0.63.0. What 1.0+ is bringing in addition is the ability to understand namespace packages properly, but for now astroid 1.3.8 doesn't support that. Thanks.
