I found that resample_to_img() and resample_img() functions do not appear to work with the latest version of Scipy 0.18.

I reverted my version of Scipy back to 0.15 which appeared to fix the problem.

Thanks,
Joe","start issue","resample_img functions incompatible with scipy 0.18"

`nilearn.image.resample_to_img(source,target)`

which gave the following warning, and the output file was empty:

> UserWarning: The behaviour of affine_transform with a one-dimensional array supplied for the matrix parameter has changed in scipy 0.18.0.

I then downgraded Scipy to version 0.15 and it worked fine.

This is just a warning.

The latest nilearn are compatible with scipy 0.18.
