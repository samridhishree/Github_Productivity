```python
def cached(ttl=0, key=None, key_attribute=None, cache=None, serializer=None, **kwargs):

    cache = get_cache(cache=cache, serializer=serializer, **kwargs)

    def cached_decorator(fn):
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            args_dict = get_args_dict(fn, args, kwargs)
            cache_key = key or args_dict.get(
                key_attribute, (fn.__module__ or 'stub') + fn.__name__ + str(args) + str(kwargs))
            if await cache.exists(cache_key):
                return await cache.get(cache_key)
            else:
                res = await fn(*args, **kwargs)
                await cache.set(cache_key, res, ttl=ttl)
                return res
        return wrapper
    return cached_decorator
```

The problem is that if `fn` raises an exception, the following appears on the console:

```
Task was destroyed but it is pending!
task: <Task pending coro=<RedisPool._do_close() running at /Users/manuelmiranda/.virtualenvs/aiocache/lib/python3.5/site-packages/aioredis/pool.py:102> wait_for=<Future pending cb=[Task._wakeup()]>>
Task was destroyed but it is pending!

```

The one giving those warnings is the `cache.exists` function which basically does:

```python
    async def exists(self, key):
        """"""
        Check key exists in the cache.

        :param key: str key to check
        :returns: True if key exists otherwise False
        """"""
        with await self._connect() as redis:
            exists = await redis.exists(key)
            return True if exists > 0 else False
```

Sorry for pasting all the code but I thought the context of executing within a decorator may be important.

Do you have any idea of what is going on? Is it because I'm defining the `cache` variable outside the function that gets executed??","start issue","Wierd error on function exception"

"issue_comment","159","aio-libs","aioredis","popravich","2016-11-04 09:08:28","Hi @argaen,
The problem is that redis pool or connection must be closed in a proper way after
(same as discussed here #154).
As far as I can see much of this warning come from your examples ([travis log](https://travis-ci.org/argaen/aiocache/builds/173116978#L276)).
To get rid of it the following must be done:
- Redis pool must be closed properly
  (using two calls `redis.close()` & `loop.run_until_complete(redis.wait_closed())`)
  
  This should lead to changes in your API:
  1. instead of initializing pool on request (in `_connect` method) pool must be configured outside
     `RedisBackend` and passed to it as argument;
  2. or RedisBackend should provide some interface to initialize and close pool it owns.

I would recomend implementing option **i** — this would allow to reuse single RedisPool for whole application.

"issue_comment","159","aio-libs","aioredis","argaen","2016-11-04 16:46:08","But why this error only appears when an exception is raised from the function the decorator is calling and not always?

@popravich this is related to the comment I did in https://github.com/aio-libs/aioredis/pull/129#issuecomment-258124744. I would like to keep the logic inside the `RedisBackend` class and having to initialize the pool (or the connection) outside breaks that common interface (meaning that for RedisBackend, I need something like a `post_init` or so).

Regarding the ii option this means that I should anyway try to catch the `Exception`, close the pool and then re-raise?

"issue_comment","159","aio-libs","aioredis","popravich","2016-11-04 21:13:00","ok, the problem why this warnings come from `exists` method is because it is a first method
which instantiates redis pool which sets up two background tasks:
connection._reader_tasks — protocol reader and parser
and `_close_waiter` — waits for `close()` call to clean up all pending connections from pool.

I think this is because `except ValueError` branch never gets executed so there is no call to `call_to_redis`
and no redis connections created

Oh man, true that. Anyway, if you check the `cached` decorator, the behavior is a bit different:

``` python
     if await cache.exists(cache_key):
         return await cache.get(cache_key)
    else:
         res = await fn(*args, **kwargs)
        await cache.set(cache_key, res, ttl=ttl)
    return res
```

If no exception is raised from `fn` I don't see any ""Task was destroyed"" messages but, if I raise and exception from that function it appears (from the call to `cache.exists`) and this is what bothers me.

Do the connections from the `_pool` close asynchronously out of the context manager scope? This is the only thing I can think of that maybe would make sense. Any other ideas?

"issue_comment","159","aio-libs","aioredis","popravich","2016-11-07 08:40:17","This warning messages is thrown when task gets deleted, so you may not see it until task is garbage collected (possibly until loop is destroyed or program exit).
Trust me, if your `fn` won't raise any error you'll see exactly the same warning but possibly in other place or time.
