```
from nilearn import image, datasets
dset = datasets.fetch_haxby()
filename = dset.func[0]

img_one = image.index_img(filename, (0, 2))
img_two = image.index_img(filename, (1, 3))
concatenated = image.concat_imgs([img_one, img_two])

print img_one.header[['qform_code', 'sform_code']]        # (0, 0)
print img_two.header[['qform_code', 'sform_code']]        # (0, 0)
print concatenated.header[['qform_code', 'sform_code']]   # (0, 2)
```

Similarly, with a 4D image with `qform_code` and `sform_code` of 1, extracting two subset images and then concatenating them also produces an output with `qform_code` of 0 and `sform_code` of 2.
