But, if I want to download 146 subjects ? Anyway it will take 1 hour right ?

We have no guarantee since we do not host the data. But `figshare` has an excellent API for managing datasets so I think that we should take advantage of it. The code to download COBRE (ie downloading the json and then each file individually) can be easily adapted to any other dataset hosted on figshare.

An option could be to rely on the big file if individual download fails but the nilearn code is not ready for it.

I am not sure: our goal is to make examples simple. To load CSVs, we
should really point users to pandas (we need to add notes about this here
and there in the documentation).
