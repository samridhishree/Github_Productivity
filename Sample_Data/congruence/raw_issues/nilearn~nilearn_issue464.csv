I've generalized the code to work for axis sizes in general.  I also abstracted a new variable, `colorbar_margin`, to try and improve code readability.  There was also code in there to control the tick formatting, that wasn't working properly; rather than remove it, I fixed it to work.

Code for producing these images, in case you'd like to test:

``` python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from nilearn import datasets
from nilearn.plotting import plot_stat_map, plot_glass_brain
from nilearn.image import index_img, iter_img

msdl_atlas_dataset = datasets.fetch_msdl_atlas()
maps_img = msdl_atlas_dataset.maps

# Just a single plot
plot_stat_map(index_img(maps_img, 0), display_mode='z', cut_coords=1)

# Row of subplots
fh = plt.figure()
for pi, img in enumerate(iter_img(index_img(maps_img, slice(None, 3)))):
    ax = fh.add_subplot(1, 3, pi + 1)
    plot_stat_map(img, axes=ax, display_mode='z', cut_coords=1)

# Grid of subplots
fh = plt.figure()
for pi, img in enumerate(iter_img(index_img(maps_img, slice(None, 16)))):
    ax = fh.add_subplot(4, 4, pi + 1)
    plot_stat_map(img, axes=ax, display_mode='z', cut_coords=1)

# No colorbars:
plot_glass_brain(index_img(maps_img, 0))

# Just a single plot
plot_stat_map(index_img(maps_img, 0))

plt.show()
```
