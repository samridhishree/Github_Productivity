This is misleading: your atlas cannot be trated by NiftiMapsMasker, it should be fed to NiftiLabelsMasker.

> some return directly a nibable.Niftiimage while others return the file name

When a Nifti1Image is returned, it is probably that some processing of the atlas was required. However, this doesn't matter as both are niimgs and can be processed by all nilearn functions.

> some just return a list while I am returning a dictionary

Well, a list can be seen as an ""int to string"" dictionary :P. I think that we should return dictionaries everywhere.

> Should this be reported as an issue?

Yes! We definitely need to harmonize the naming conventions and return types. However, I have no time to do it. Let's merge your PR and then solve the problem of the naming.
