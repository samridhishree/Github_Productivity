I am having a small issue working on these AAL2 files though. The voxel values in the .txt labels file don't match the voxel values. The voxel values have a '01' or '02' ""appended"" to them depending if it is left or right hemisphere. Does this sound familiar to you?

On the other hand, my boss says that AAL is not very precise (I'm not the physician to argue), in fact I will be using the Hammer atlas instead. This is from http://www.brain-development.org/
AFAIK adding this to nilearn requires a license acceptance though.

Yes, it's horrible. We have it because it is standard.

:(

It's thus probably not possible to have it, unless they are willing to do
a specific arrangement.

It would be fantastic if you would contact them. We can put a note in the
documentation stipulating the conditions of use. We cannot put something
where there is an action from the user, as things need to be able to run
without user intervention, eg on clusters.

Thanks for the intention.
