The Request() constructor doesn't give the request.oauth_token attribute that the create_authorization_response relies on. The _create_request() method doesn't either, but it gives something equivalent.

5,issue_comment,197,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2013-07-19 19:18:21,"@kdazzle Thanks for the PR!

I initially avoided the use of _create_request because earlier that implementation would cause this to fail because it also checked the request signature (which there is none during this step). It seems like this works well now tho and agree that an update might be in order.

Could you please also update the documentation with the error message thrown if oauth_token is not set on request.

Oh and feel free to push more changes to this PR.

6,issue_comment,197,idan,oauthlib,kdazzle,2013-07-19 22:19:45,"@ib-lundgren Thanks for creating (and maintaining) such an awesome library!

I made the changes you suggested and a couple of others in the endpoints. However, I couldn't find any documentation related to the NotImplementedError, so I didn't make any changes there.

7,issue_comment,197,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2013-07-22 20:56:27,"@kdazzle Great work. I am surprised that I overlooked such large oversights like the nonce validation token parameter. Will push a point release when this is addressed.

Many bonus points if you add tests for this =)

Feel free to add yourself to authors too.

I haven't been able to do any tests, but I will try to write some soon so that everyone's life (except Travis CI's) can get a bit easier.

9,issue_comment,197,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2013-07-23 17:08:35,"Looking good. For the tests an ``assert_called_with` similar to below around https://github.com/idan/oauthlib/blob/master/tests/oauth1/rfc5849/endpoints/test_resource.py#L75 (and equiv. for the other endpoints) would go far.

```
self.validator.validate_timestamp_and_nonce.assert_called_once_with(
             self.client.client_key, mock.ANY, mock.ANY, mock.ANY,
             access_token=self.client.resource_owner_key)

12,pull_request_commit_comment,197,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2013-07-19 19:16:31,"Not sure what caused me to write this check in this manner. If you fancy move the token check up before self.request_valdiator.verify_request_token and make it raise

```
 raise errors.InvalidRequestError(
                 description=('oauth_token parameter must be present '
                                    'in the URL query.'))

or similar that would be awesome.
