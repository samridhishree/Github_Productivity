Keeping a local version doesn't mean that we will branch. The idea is to
have a synchronization script that copies exactly the sphinx-gallery code
in the projects that use it. In these projects it should never be
modified. One example of this pattern is how joblib is integrated in
scikit-learn, in sklearn/externals.

More practical for you. It raises two problems. One is of technicality.
It's one more thing to learn and master for a contributor. These things
pile up and make it harder and harder to contribute to a project. The
second problem is that it means that any backword incompatible change or
bug introduce in sphinx-gallery will break the projects using it.
Decoupling is a good thing.

:+1:. We cannot have a joblib dependency.

I would actually favor not using joblib but a simple shelve, and a test
to see if the URL is already in the shelve.

Here is some pseudo code to implement what I have in mind:

<pre>
import shelve
mem = shelve.open('foo')
if not url in mem:
    data = get_url(url)
    mem[url] = data
    mem.sync()
else:
    data = mem[url]
</pre>

I'd rather not. Creeping dependencies are a problem, and we must tackle
them. The pseudo code that I have given demonstrates how easy it is to
use shelve.

Well, as Oscar is mentionning, it's already posing problems for CI.

But anyhow, let us foster adoption by having little dependencies.

I guess it's up to each project to make a choice whether they want to ship sphinx-gallery or not. The main point of doing so is pure convenience for people generating the doc.

About sphinx-gallery evolving separately in different projects, there is an implicit agreement that only released versions of sphinx-gallery should be used and that potential changes should be propagated upstream.

> I was having a look at the scikit-learn externals. It is a static set of code that gets updated manually, why? and why the extra install scripts within that module?

I guess convenience again is the main reason. Users are spared having to install a few packages in order to use scikit-learn. I think the technical term is vendorizing, you may want to see what the internet has to say about it. I didn't know about the extra install scripts in external so I can't help on this one.

Publishing sphinx-gallery as 0.0.7 with the shelve is straight forward, can upload to pypi now. But I wouldn't launch it yet as a stable release. As some to do from @GaelVaroquaux are still missing. https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/issues/20

Fair enough, how long do you need roughly to be reasonably confident there is no major issues?

Because sphinx-gallery is not used massively at the moment backward-incompatible changes are not such a big deal I would say.

The good: no extra package to install to generate the doc for nilearn, scikit-learn, and other packages users that have scikit-learn installed.

The not that great: a tiny bit of scikit-learn specific code for projects that are potentially unrelated.
