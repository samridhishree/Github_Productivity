"issue_comment","291","idan","oauthlib","ib-lundgren","2014-11-06 19:51:56","@thedrow my apologies, it was released quite hastily to fix a few errors downstream. The only change in 0.7.1 compared to 0.7.0 is that I put the oauthlib.common.log object back in. While this is not really meant to be used by others it seems it was :)

0.7.0 includes quite a few changes however and its mostly documented in the changelog file https://github.com/idan/oauthlib/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst
