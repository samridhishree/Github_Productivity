It would be good to add a test in nilearn/plotting/tests/test_img_plotting.py that tests exactly the problem that you report. It's a well testable problem, and adding a test will make our codebase more robust.

Thanks!","",""

There are few things need to be done before merge.

- ```threshold=threshold``` is missed specifying in ```_plot_img_with_bg```. By specifying that, user can now pass their threshold to rois, if needed.
- In the ```plot_roi``` docstring at parameter ```threshold```. You should add ```default=0.5```.
- Add a Notes section above See Also. In Notes, adding a single line saying that ""A very small threshold is applied by default to eliminate numerical noise from the images background. Otherwise, images will be plotted with background noise.""

See issue #443 for more discussion on this. Somehow that issue got closed without addressing.
