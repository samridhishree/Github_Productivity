I just started to learn to use your functions and I tried to use you plotting function and got the following error : 
<nilearn.plotting.displays.OrthoSlicer at 0x7f22cbd27e80>
/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/matplotlib/cbook.py:136: MatplotlibDeprecationWarning: The axisbg attribute was deprecated in version 2.0. Use facecolor instead.
  warnings.warn(message, mplDeprecation, stacklevel=1)

So as you can see I have python 3.6 and matplotlib seems to be upgraded to the latest version. 

Did I make a mistake ? 

Thank you in advance !
