There are a couple of nodes in the builtin module **ast** which provide a `.ctx` member, useful for determining in what context these nodes occurred, with types such as **Store**, for instance for `x[1] = 2`, **Del** for `del x[1]` and **Load** for the rest of them. Might be useful for pylint for disambiguating between a `__getitem__` call or a  `__setitem__` call.

Some nodes got a new attribute, 'ctx', which tells in which context the said node was used.

The possible values for the contexts are `Load` ('a'), `Del` ('del a'),
`Store` ('a = 4') and the nodes that got the new attribute are Starred,
Subscript, List and Tuple. The builtin ast module provides contexts for
Name and Attribute as well, but we took a different approach in the past,
by having different nodes for each type of context. For instance, Name
used in a Del context is a DelName, while Name used in a Store
context is AssignName. Since this is ingrained in astroid since quite
some time, it makes no sense to change them as well, even though it's
a loss of consistency.
The patch introduces a new dependency to enum34 on older Python
versions, which is used for building the three possible enum values
for the contexts.

Closes issue #267.
