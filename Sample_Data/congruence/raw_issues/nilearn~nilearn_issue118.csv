I see in the `doc/extracting_data.rst` file that this code references the file `plot_adhd_covariance.py`, which has the `n_subjects` referenced at the top of the file.  So I just moved the `n_subjects` reference to appear in that code section so that it will appear on the webpage.  Not sure if this is where it should be referenced, but this could certainly cause confusion for folks trying to go through the examples on the webpage.

This is very useful. We need to worry about backward compat :) :
https://travis-ci.org/nilearn/nilearn/jobs/12995020

I need to run to lunch, but I'll look at this afterwards.

"issue_comment","118","nilearn","nilearn","GaelVaroquaux","2013-10-25 12:14:45","OK, I had a look at this, and it seems to me that you have been changing 'scoring' to 'score_func'. This is exactly the reverse way to go: scikit-learn as changed from score_func to scoring almost a year ago. If you are having problems running the code, I suspect that you have an old scikit-learn around

However, this is fine. We need to make sure that the code also run on older scikit-learn versions.

"issue_comment","118","nilearn","nilearn","GaelVaroquaux","2013-10-25 22:57:28","OK, I cheery-picked the patches that didn't lead to problems, but I didn't have time to update the docs. It would be great if you had time to do the later. I am closing the PR for now. Feel free to open a new one.

With regards to your comments on the docs: I fully agree with you that the docs aren't at the level of the user. I am working on a fairly full-on rewriting of the docs, including a massive change of organisation in the docs, in order to have two layer : a section for less-expert end users, and a more technical section. It's all very work-in-progress, but I am pushing it at https://github.com/GaelVaroquaux/nilearn/tree/new_docs

Thanks for your feedback. I will take a look at your PR later, as we are now hacking for the BrainHack unconference. We're in the process of refactoring the doc (as we do periodically) so we would really glad to get some strong feedback from you (other than fixing typos). So if you have any comment on the general organization of the doc, do not hesitate to share !

Thanks again,

Alex.
