This warning is unrelated to screening percentile. I just want to raise
the message that people are using the package in a weird way.

Maybe something like 'SpaceNet is probably not tuned to be used on such

I don't really like such logic: checking a formula in the code by the
same formula in the tests. Indeed, it leads often to errors in the code
copy-pasted in the tests, and thus not detected.

I prefer to check a property of the problem that we expect. Here the fact
that in a small brain mask, a small screening percentile selects the
whole mask.
