Unfortunately, I've introduced an infinite recursion that's occurring in a lot of the tests on Python 2.  There has to be a base case here, but I'm not sure what it is.

``` python
  File ""astroid/scoped_nodes.py"", line 155, in locals
    return MappingProxyType(get_locals(self))
  File ""~/code/astroid/.tox/py27/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/singledispatch.py"", line 210, in wrapper
    return dispatch(args[0].__class__)(*args, **kw)
  File ""astroid/scoped_nodes.py"", line 1874, in scoped_node
    _get_locals(n, locals_, node)
  File ""~/code/astroid/.tox/py27/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/singledispatch.py"", line 210, in wrapper
    return dispatch(args[0].__class__)(*args, **kw)
  File ""astroid/scoped_nodes.py"", line 1949, in locals_import_from
    imported = node.do_import_module()
  File ""astroid/mixins.py"", line 116, in do_import_module
    if mymodule.relative_to_absolute_name(modname, level) == mymodule.name:
  File ""astroid/scoped_nodes.py"", line 515, in relative_to_absolute_name
    if self.absolute_import_activated() and level is None:
  File ""astroid/scoped_nodes.py"", line 491, in absolute_import_activated
    return self._absolute_import_activated
  File ""astroid/decorators.py"", line 79, in __get__
    val = self.wrapped(inst)
  File ""astroid/scoped_nodes.py"", line 483, in _absolute_import_activated
    for stmt in self.locals.get('absolute_import', ()):
  File ""astroid/scoped_nodes.py"", line 155, in locals
    return MappingProxyType(get_locals(self))
```

Fixed in 3e3b3e936b69 by using the new future_imports property.
