I guess that is what I have done. I kept narrative docs simple without code snippets.
In example a bit more.

+1: this is an advanced example, it's good to teach nibabel to these
users.

Right, but it's a fairly specific function. And I worry about having a
too big public API: it makes things harder to find.
