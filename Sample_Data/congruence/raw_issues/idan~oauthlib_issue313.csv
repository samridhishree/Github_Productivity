```
xmlStr = '<share><comment>This is a comment.</comment><content><title>This is the title</title><description>This is the description</description><submitted-url>http://www.isittuesday.co.uk</submitted-url><submitted-image-url>http://stunningplaces.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/11-Rio-de-Janeiro-Cochabana-Beach.-Photo-by-ballnkicka.com_.jpg</submitted-image-url></content><visibility><code>connections-only</code></visibility></share>'
r = linkedInApp.post('people/~/shares', data=xmlStr, content_type='application/xml')
```

But this creates the following request:

```
POST https://api.linkedin.com/v1/people/~/shares?oauth2_access_token=XXXXX
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
```

On [this page](http://flask-oauthlib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/client.html) it indeed says that for outgoing requests, OAutlib only supports `'urlencode'` and `'json'`. So I also tried setting the header like this:

```
r = linkedInApp.post('people/~/shares', data=xmlStr, headers={'Content-Type': 'application/xml'})
```

which gives me the traceback below. Does anybody know how I can get OAuthLib to set the header to `'application/xml'`? All tips are welcome!
