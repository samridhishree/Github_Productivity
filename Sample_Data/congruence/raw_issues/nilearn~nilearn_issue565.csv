Code Snippet: same as plot_probabilistic but few changes

``` python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from nilearn import datasets, image, plotting

atlas_data = datasets.fetch_msdl_atlas()
atlas_filename = atlas_data.maps

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(4, 5.4), facecolor='k')
display = plotting.plot_stat_map(image.index_img(atlas_filename, 1),
                                                   figure=fig,colorbar=False)
display.add_overlay(image.index_img(atlas_filename, 8),
                                cmap=plotting.cm.black_pink)
display.add_overlay(image.index_img(atlas_filename, 25),
                                cmap=plotting.cm.black_green)
display.add_overlay(image.index_img(atlas_filename, 13),
                               cmap=plotting.cm.black_red)
plt.show()
```

Case1: Few atlas maps (08, 13, 25, 26) are behaved properly without ""vmin"" and ""vmax"" and ""without any threshold"" as shown below in the figures

Case 2: With ""threshold = None""
Code Snippet:

``` python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from nilearn import datasets, image, plotting

atlas_data = datasets.fetch_msdl_atlas()
atlas_filename = atlas_data.maps

display = plotting.plot_stat_map(image.index_img(atlas_filename, 4),
                                                   colorbar=False,
                                                   title=""DMN nodes in MSDL atlas"")
display.add_overlay(image.index_img(atlas_filename, 8),
                                cmap=plotting.cm.black_pink,threshold=None)
display.add_overlay(image.index_img(atlas_filename, 13),
                                cmap=plotting.cm.black_red,threshold=None)
display.add_overlay(image.index_img(atlas_filename, 25),
                                cmap=plotting.cm.black_green,threshold=None)
plt.show()
```

Case 3: When chosen same atlas maps compared with Case 1, we miss blobs here.
Code Snippet:

``` python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from nilearn import datasets, image, plotting

atlas_data = datasets.fetch_msdl_atlas()
atlas_filename = atlas_data.maps

display = plotting.plot_stat_map(image.index_img(atlas_filename, 4),
                                                   colorbar=False,
                                                   title=""DMN nodes in MSDL atlas"")
display.add_overlay(image.index_img(atlas_filename, 8),
                                cmap=plotting.cm.black_pink)
display.add_overlay(image.index_img(atlas_filename, 13),
                                cmap=plotting.cm.black_red)
display.add_overlay(image.index_img(atlas_filename, 25),
                                cmap=plotting.cm.black_green)
plt.show()
```
