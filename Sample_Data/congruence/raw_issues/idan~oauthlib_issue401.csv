following an [invitation](https://oauthlib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/oauth2/server.html#implement-a-validator) in the documentation to give better name for the RequestValidator class, I would like to suggest an **`OAuthServerDelegate`** or **`OAuthLibDelegate`** or any other **`-Delegate`** wording. (The former seems logical to me since it is passed to a Server constructor as an argument)

I believe such naming pattern matches the use case directly, since it is being called for a number of reasons during the lifecycle of the request processing by different entities. WDYT?
