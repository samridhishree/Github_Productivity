``` python
from nilearn import datasets, plotting, image
data = datasets.fetch_adhd()
mean_func = image.mean_img(data.func[1])
display = plotting.plot_epi(mean_func)
display.add_edges(image.mean_img(data.func[1]), color='w')
```

**Glitch 1:** once all the lines are executed the plot is not refreshed, to have the contour, I need to call manually 'plt.draw()'. We probably need to add a 'plt.draw_if_interactive()' at the end of the add_edges method (and we should check whether it is necessary for add_contour and add_overlay)

**Glitch 2:** In this setting, the alpha is too low, and thus the edges are not visible. I am in favor of removing the alpha (which I implemented in a hacky way with an alpha_cmap, and simply using a hard color).
