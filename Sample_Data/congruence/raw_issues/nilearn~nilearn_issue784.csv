cut_coords : None, a tuple of floats, or an integer
            The MNI coordinates of the point where the cut is performed
            If display_mode is 'ortho', this should be a 3-tuple: (x, y, z)
            For display_mode == 'x', 'y', or 'z', then these are the
            coordinates of each cut in the corresponding direction.
            If None is given, the cuts is calculated automaticaly.
            If display_mode is 'x', 'y' or 'z', cut_coords can be an integer,
            in which case it specifies the number of cuts to perform

If _cut_coords_ is a scalar (as in your example), then it's expected to be
and integer representing the number of cuts you want. We can't do the
coercing automatically, as this would run into conflicts with the rest of
the logic. The error you're getting is because the 0 you passed for
_cut_coords_ is being interpreted as number of slices (_n_cuts_ in your
traceback), leading to a zero-division. The latter tells us there is a
stealth bug in the _find_cuts_ function: it should sanitize the value
_n_cuts_ param and throw a meaningful error in case invalid (for example,
in case it's _0_).

@KamalakerDadi, if you have some spare time, that shouldn't be too hard to do.
