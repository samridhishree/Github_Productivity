I have a directed connectome resulting from Granger causality in a form a matrix and I'd like to visualize it in the from of a graph. I used plot_connectome function, but instead of using lines I ploted arrows.
It looks like this:

I can send a PR if you like it.
I think that tools which are able to produce directed connectomes are sparse, so it would be great if nilearn support such plotting. In this way or another:)

What's the interface that you have in mind? Maybe adding a ""directed=False"" argument to ""plot_connectome"" and the add_graph method of the glass brain object?

Thanks for stepping up!","",""
