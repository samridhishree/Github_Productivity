I was pleased (and surprised) to see that nilearn offers some apparently quite nice plotting functions (at least for human data). I am wondering:
- Why does it make sense to package these plotting functions together with functions better described by ni_learn_? Would it not be more intuitive (and perhaps make the plotting function modules more readily recognisable as such)  to package them as ""niplot"" or something of the sort?
- Is there any (more-or-less) easy way to plot some rodent data with the functions currently offered by nilearn?

Glass Brain was made by hand. Take a look at

nilearn/nilearn/plotting/glass_brain_files/*.svg

You will see that there are three vector drawings. If you can create these
for the main gyri/sulci of the mouse brain, you can have a mouse glass
brain.

So it depends on how much effort you want to put into it.

This has been discussed and the code is not mature enough to be separated from the core.

You can customize the background image used for regular plotting functions. For `plot_glass_brain`, the background template can be customized but it is not trivial for the moment.

What do you need exactly ?

However, I worry a lot about people not realigning their backgrounds
well, and publishing plots that are incorrect.

Also, I am afraid that this feature is going to generate a lot of user
support problems (my brain is not well aligned, please help).

I am a bit unsure whether it is wise to open this pandora box.

This is already the case with the current background: we have no guarantee that the data provided is aligned with it.

Maybe we can give a choice at least between the SVG and a 3D image?

Maybe just a 3D mask image and we compute the online of it (easy, just
compute the max along the direction and do a contour in matplotlib?

in it in the short term, though, given how overcommitted we are.
