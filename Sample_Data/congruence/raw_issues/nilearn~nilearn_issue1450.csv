I have noticed a difference between `plot_anat` and `plot_roi` regarding the size in which the brain is displayed. With `plot_roi` it nearly fills the entire image, with `plot_anat` it is much smaller.
Is there a way to zoom in on the `plot_anat` images as well? Thanks.

`plot_roi`

Basically, we need to use better the get_bounds mechanism in the
add_contours method of the objects in displays.py to set a tighter
bounding box, as we do in the _map_show method.

Good point. So what we should do would be, in map_show, to set a
threshold a bit below the minimum contour, so that the mechanism of
bounding box is reused.

I've tried something in this direction in
https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/1459 . It's a rough sketch done
while listening to a talk. @fliem, can you check that it solves your
problem.

While `plot_anat` displays the brain large if I add `threshold=1e-6`, adding a contour to the display shrinks it back again. Adding a threshold to the`.add_contours` call  doesn't help. Thanks!
```
display = plotting.plot_anat(brain, threshold=1e-6)
display.add_contours(contour, colors='r', threshold=1e-6)
