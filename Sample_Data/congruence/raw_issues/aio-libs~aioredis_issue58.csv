You can always start with tests coverage.
Server commands have not been tested fully and we need some tests to, atleast, be sure that there are no typos.

As for new features -- I need to think it over.

I'm thinking to use unittest and py.test to start the process to coverage the library. It's ok?

Just use

$ make cov

We already have unittests and just a bit custom script to run them.
You can run tests with `make test` or `make cov` commands, or
directly by running `python3 runtest.py`
