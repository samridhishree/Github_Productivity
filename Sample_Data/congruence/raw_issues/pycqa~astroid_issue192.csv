Closely related to #115.

We should try to understand the various forms of augmented assignments. The simplest case, for instance, causes false positives with numpy.core (which is _fixed_ in astroid through a transform, not the proper fix though)

```
#!python

a = [...]
a += [...]
a += [...]
a # infer with all mutations
```

Since I gave numpy.core as an example, the **all** attribute is computed by adding the **all** values of subimports into this attribute through augmented assignment.
