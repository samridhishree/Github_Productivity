usage of the nilearn API in unsupervised setting. We should say in the

Alex, I think that you are going to have to rely on the (horrible) trick
used by Cameron: threshold the correlations to have connections and thus
speed up the algorithm.

A percentile looks good. Take whatever is necessary to make the example
run in 10mn.
