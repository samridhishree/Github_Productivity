I'm new to using github, etc.  Is there something I should have done to
make the pull easier for you?  Should I have combined the commits
together?  Should I have not tried to synced with upstream/master?

I'm asking because it is likely that I'll have a few more small patches to
astroid in the near future and I want to make things as smooth as possible
for you.

I prefer to have the commits squashed if they are not part of a bigger feature, in that case having some smaller chunks makes more sense. Also you should use rebase for feature branches, so that you won't be needing syncing with the upstream/master. It should be good after that, the cherry-picking is something that I must do, since we have multiple branches of development at the moment.

Thanks for the (future) contributions, let me know if there is something I could help you with.

"issue_comment","305","pycqa","astroid","dbaum","2016-01-15 16:38:46","I'm trying to understand the workflow.  Should I be doing my work on a
brach, keep my master at (or behind) the upstream master, then rebase my
feature branch to master and squash the commits at that point?  Something
like:

git checkout -b new-feature master
git commit -a -m ""some work""
git commit -a -m ""some more work""

# I'm a little fuzzy on exactly what commands to use here.  The idea is to

bring my

# master up to date with the upstream master.

git pull upsstream/master

# Go back to working on my fix...

git checkout new-feature
git commit -a -m ""even more work""

# Clean things up before a pull request.

git rebase -i master
