No, not when 0.18 is installed. We need to make an adaption layer.

The cross_validation module is going to be deprecated in 0.20 not 0.18.
The check_cv in model_selection does not receive X as param, as well as the CV API. Then, we have to think about this deprecation in near future --e.g. using cross validation in Nilearn examples.
For the moment we can still use the check_cv in cross_validation.
