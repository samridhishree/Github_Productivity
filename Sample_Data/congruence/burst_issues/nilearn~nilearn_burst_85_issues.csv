Such flexibility means that error capture and managment becomes very
hard. In scikit-learn, we have actually gone the other way, and
explicitely made such flexibility impossible.

Missing images generally are a symptom of an error in an example. Looking at the first failure in master (https://circleci.com/gh/nilearn/nilearn/1880), the root problem seems to be:

```

the `__init__`method of estimators found in `nilearn.decomposition`, such as `CanICA` and `DictLearning`, accepts parameters for their masker. When `fit` is called we use `check_embedded_nifti_masker`, from `input_data.masker_validation`, to create an apropriate masker. At some point this function checks that none of the masker's parameters overrides parameters passed to the estimator's `__init__`(which does not seem necessary in the case in which no mask was given to the estimator, since in this case the masker's parameters are read directly from the estimator's) and emit a warning if they do. However, this check is performed using `if(estimator_param != masker_param)` , and some of these parameters are numpy arrays, resulting in an exception being raised by the `__nonzero__` method of the result of the comparison since it has more than one element:

`ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
`
the error can be reproduced with:

```
from nilearn import datasets, decomposition
from nilearn._utils import testing

def pass_masker_params_to_estimator():
    image = testing.generate_fake_fmri()
    target_img = datasets.load_mni152_template()
    estimator = decomposition.DictLearning(target_affine=target_img.affine, 
                               target_shape=target_img.shape)
    estimator.fit(image)

pass_masker_params_to_estimator()
```

in  `check_embedded_nifti_masker` the problem arises here:

```
   # Raising warning if masker override parameters
   conflict_string = """"
   for param_key in sorted(estimator_params):
       if new_masker_params[param_key] != estimator_params[param_key]:

And there is a nice thing here, which is that for group studies, I would
recommend the LedoitWolf, as GraphLassoCV has instabilities that will
vary from subject to subject, however, for
single-subject, this clearly ilustrates that we should prefer
GraphLassoCV. So, if we teach people to use ConnectivityMeasure for group
analysis, and do things manually in the single subject case, it makes
sense.

I'd rather reorder them in them CSV.

However, I think that changing this silently is a bit dangerous.

We could add an option to the loader, and warn that in 1 release the
default will change and the non reordered version will disappear.

- transform: this is transformation to vector space $R^p$, and for `tangent` this is the displacement who lives in the vector space -> to be used in statistical tests, and classification
- inverse transform: just back from vector to matrix, without any diabolic rescaling -> useful for p-values plotting

This is useful for second-level analyses, which is compatible with the strategy of teaching `ConnectivityMeasure` for multi-subjects. If they want to recover individual matrices, they do the `inverse_transform`. This way, the complexity of the tangent model is completely hidden, and outputs are homogeneous across kinds.
While we are on it, I was also thinking of adding `discard_diagonal` to `ConnectivityMeasure`, for practical reasons :
- Fisher Z-transform gives nan on the diagonal 1.,
- t-tests  display an ugly Runtime warning when one coefficient is the same across all subjects

Probably I'm doing something wrong (different versions or so ?):

I'm investigating what I can do with Jupyter notebooks and came across some very nice looking notebooks from NiLearn, As I'm both new to Jupyter en NiLearn, this combination seems to be too difficult.

Already in the second code window< i ran into a bug: I had to change the last line

from nilearn import datasets, plotting
atlas_img = datasets.fetch_atlas_harvard_oxford('cort-maxprob-thr25-2mm')
# plotting.plot_roi ( atlas_img)

plotting.plot_roi ( atlas_img.maps )

masker = NiftiLabelsMasker(labels_img=atlas_img.labels )

I didn't mean testing the API, I meant statistical tests in the example, when I am using `scipy.stats.ttest_1samp` to extract significant connections.
We can do these statistical tests on the Z-Fisher transformed `correlation` or `partial correlation` coefficients, because there is some theory behind. But for the `tangent` kind the theory is not the same, and the statistical tests would _rather_ be `scipy.stats.chisquare`. I say _rather_ because you see I am not sure, and I need to look into this but I have no time for the moment.

In your paper I think the subject displacements are _assumed_ to follow a normal distribution. From what I understand, to  do the testing we need to have a Central Limit Theorem that proves the asymptotic normality. Actually such theorem exist for the `tangent` mean, but those theoretical papers point to chi square tests.

I think that people (methods developers) might use it to build their own
algorithms. As nilearn is also for methods developers, I think that it
makes sense to expose it publicaly.

I have to correct the doc, but `p + 1` is correct here.
Your questions tell me my code is unclear and I have to rework it. May be I can add a little function that computes the shape of the symmetric matrix from the given vector, and also add a section example to illustrate how it works: if you enter a vector that does not include the diagonal in it, the computed shape from the equation is less than the true matrix shape

``` Python
sym = np.array([[1., .3, .1], [.3, 1., .5], [.1, .5, 1.]])
vec = sym_matrix_to_vec(sym, discard_diagonal=True)
# Recover the matrix shape
n = np.shape(vec)[-1]
p = (sqrt(8 * n + 1) - 1.) / 2
n_columns = int(p) + 1
print n_columns

for `kind=""correlation""` or `kind=""partial correlation""`, nothing happens
for `kind=""tangent""`, the covariance matrices are reconstructed. The output of `transform` for tangent are not connectivity matrices, but deviations from a group connectivity matrix.

Yes, I would think so. I stumbled on this when teaching on Monday.

Another option I thought of is this:

`coord_transform([1], [2], [3], np.eye(4))` returns a 3-tuple of list `([1], [2], [3])`

I still have no idea what causes it. I tried to roll back both my nilearn and scikits_learn versions thinking this might have happened after an updater - but Is till get this. Any ideas?

I have no idea. I don't use gentoo. Looks plausible, though.

Good to know. I think that we should do both: first deal with nans in the
maps_img, second add an ensure_finite=False kwarg to clean_img.

Notice how the orientation of the hemispheric plot is broken.

If I add an image, instead of None, in the glass brain, it works right.
