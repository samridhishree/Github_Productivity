"issue_comment","289","pycqa","astroid","PCManticore","2016-06-27 17:32:52","I don't think it is worth it. The last release that they seemed to have, according to their homepage (http://ironpython.net/), was at the end of 2014. We already have some backwards compatibility problems with Jython and PyPy and it is quite hard to provide a good support story with our current limited resources. I would prefer to invest in CPython and PyPy for now.
