It shouldn't: joblib doesn't use the repr, but an actual hash of the
data. There must be something more. Do you have a small example to
reproduce the problem. I'd love to look at it.

I will make a patch for my usecase (call get_data() on the loaded Nifti1Image in masker if a path is given) and maybe add a note in documentation (this would be a good occasion to start a troubleshooting page).

Later. First we announce it on the Nipy mailing list. And to do this, we
need to fix a bunch of things (the APIs are not stable yet, for instance
the memory_level is missing).

My attempts to install nilearn have failed so far, I cannot seem to
find what the problem is.

My system has Ubuntu Linux with python 2.7.3
![install_log txt gz](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5262793/987158/61ead10e-08e6-11e3-9f7e-19dfd61c94bf.jpg)

(python3 and python3.2 also present but not default)

and
 numpy     v1.6.1
 scipy       v0.9.0
 sklearn    v0.14.1
 matplotlib v1.1.1rc

The steps I have taken are:
1. git clone https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn.git python/nilearn
2. git remote add nilearn https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn.git
3. cd python/nilearn;   make install
4. cd ../../;                 git pull nilearn master # today
5. cd python/nilearn;   make install

But the messages I get (see attached) suggests that many library import fail.
Does this mean that there still are unmet dependencies?

Many thanks for your help!

With best wishes
Alle Meije Wink

This should be fixed right now. However, you should install nilearn by doing ""make install"" in nilearn directory, not in the doc directory.

Alexandre.

7,issue_comment,98,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2013-08-21 11:29:43,"Hi Alle,

Thanks for your feedback ! We try as much as possible to run compilation from scratch but I think my local repository is polluted by temporary files.

To use nilearn, you do not need to 'make' it. Normally, cloning the git repository is enough:

```
git clone https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn.git
python plot_rest_clustering.py
```

... should work (nilearn will be imported locally). If you really want to install it, use:

```
python setup.py install
```

I will try to fix the bugs you pointed out as fast as possible but I have other tasks pending. I hope that these installation problems did not dissuade you tu use nilearn !

Do not hesitate to give us a feedback and, if you have an interesting experiment using open data, then maybe we could add it as an example !

Best,

Alexandre.

I did run make from the nilearn directory (as described)?
If I ended up in the doc directory that must have been where the Makefile left me...

After the git pull I still had to manually change 
 ./doc/_build/html/_downloads/plot_nifti_advanced.py
 ./doc/_build/html/_downloads/plot_old_canica_resting_state.py
 ./doc/_build/html/_downloads/plot_ica_resting_state.py
 ./doc/auto_examples/plot_nifti_advanced.py
 ./doc/auto_examples/plot_old_canica_resting_state.py
 ./doc/auto_examples/plot_ica_resting_state.py
 ./plot_nifti_advanced.py
 ./plot_old_canica_resting_state.py
 ./plot_ica_resting_state.py
to replace io by input_data

Also in 
 emacs doc/Makefile 
there is a mention of niearn which should probably be nilearn.

After doing all that the commands <in the nilearn directory>
make clean && make install

result in the following output: 
![install log](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5262793/1000671/81904a62-0a52-11e3-80e3-4977c30e6433.jpg)
--another jpg text file--

I've done this a couple of time in a row, and in short
1. the example scripts only need to run one time, except the plot_old_canica_resting_state.py script, which is called twice in every 'make install', and is not successful
2. the pdf file is not built (possibly because of a syntax error in \FancyVerb [which I dont know]?)
3. after the pdf generation, another clone attempt also fails.

Hope this report is of use, very happy that the clustering script works.
