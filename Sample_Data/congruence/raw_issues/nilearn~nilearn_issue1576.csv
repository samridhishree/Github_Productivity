I have a fmri image in MNI space (79x95x79) and using NiftiMasker(mask_img=datasets.fetch_icbm152_2009(), ....) it 
returns more voxels than the voxels my image has (79x95x79).

"issue_comment","1576","nilearn","nilearn","grjd","2017-11-28 08:48:53","I understand that the mask has more voxels that I need, 197x233x189 to be precise. 
But I don't understand if I extract the time series  I get time series that can not possibly being extracted from my epi_file. I get over 1M time series while my epi_file has just 79x95x79=592895 voxels.
The epi_file is already normalized in MNI space I just need to extract all the time series from epi_file.

```
masker = NiftiMasker(mask_img=datasets.fetch_icbm152_2009(), detrend=preproc_parameters['detrend'],t_r=preproc_parameters['t_r'])
masker.fit_transform(epi_file)
