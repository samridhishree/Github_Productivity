For some atlases, we want to use ""labels"" for the brain components since the atlas is actually contained in a single label map but we can't because this would clash with other datasets.

I think we should follow the same convention for all atlases.

Also, I think that it would be good to always return a dictionary when we associate label values to names, even if they are integer. It is easier to use and more consistent.
