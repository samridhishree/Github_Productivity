Not precise data can get into node.locals.
For example test code:

```
""""""unused import""""""
import xml.etree  # [unused-import]
import xml.sax  # [unused-import]
```

node.locals contains:

```
#!python
{'xml': [<Import() l.2 [functional.unused_import] at 0x7f18cde2ec10>, <Import() l.3 [functional.unused_import] at 0x7f18cde46090>]}
```

xml is not a local name. It cannot be referenced in code. 
There is only available either xml.etree or xml.sax.

Wouldn't it be better to fix node.locals that it contains:

```
#!python
{'xml.etree': [<Import() l.2 [functional.unused_import] at 0x7f18cde2ec10>],
 'xml.sax': [<Import() l.3 [functional.unused_import] at 0x7f18cde46090>]}
```

This issue is related to issue pylint#293.

this is not true, in your example 'xml' **is** a local name, as demonstrated below:

```
#!python

>>> import xml.etree
>>> print xml
<module 'xml' from '/usr/lib/python2.7/xml/__init__.pyc'>
```

the 'import x.y' form of import in python is importing the 'x' package, then the 'y' subpackage/module, then bind 'x' to the local namespace.
