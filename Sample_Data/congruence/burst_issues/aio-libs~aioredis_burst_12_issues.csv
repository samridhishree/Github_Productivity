- the example doesn't run, not even nearly. I guess it should be more like the [example](https://github.com/aio-libs/aioredis/blob/master/examples/pubsub.py) in the examples directory.
- `asyncio.async` is depreciated in favour of `asyncio.ensure_future`
- `async_reader2` is defined by never use, i guess the last line should be using it.

Those examples was intended to demonstrate the way to work with pub/sub;

> `asyncio.async` is depreciated in favour of `asyncio.ensure_future`

This is true for Python 3.4.4+. This is a bit harder to change 'cause `aioredis` claims to support Python 3.3

> async_reader2 is defined by never use, i guess the last line should be using it.

And again, it's just to demonstrate an idea.

I'm pretty sure the last line has a typo and should be referencing `async_reader2`.

A link to the example would be good but for me the code in the docs is more confusing than helpful, why not just replace it with the example?
