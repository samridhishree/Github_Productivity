While both have straightforward implementations, there is variation in the literature. It may therefore be both high-yield to implement both meta-estimators in nilearn and thus also increase comparability and standardization in using advanced learning algorithm in neuroimaging.","start issue","Add bagging and boosting meta-estimators"

Anyhow, PRs are welcome indeed !","",""
