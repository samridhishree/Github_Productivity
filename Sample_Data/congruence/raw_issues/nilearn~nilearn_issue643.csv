"issue_title","643","nilearn","nilearn","AlexandreAbraham","2015-07-13 10:11:29","Fix #611.
Supersedes #621.

I introduced a `dtype='auto'` in `check_niimg` that converts data to `int32` if it is integral and `float32` if it is real. I use it in the plotting functions so that we never end up with unsigned type. However, we are not protected from unsigned values given as threshold or vmax. I solved the current problem by casting explicitely the threshold to float but I don't know if it's the best way to do.
