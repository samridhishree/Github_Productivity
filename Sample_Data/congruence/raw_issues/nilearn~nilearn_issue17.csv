"issue_title","17","nilearn","nilearn","AlexandreAbraham","2012-06-25 13:15:44","In _plot_haxby_decoding_, some assertions are given about Haxby dataset shape in comments :

``` python
# fmri_data.shape is (40, 64, 64, 1452)
# and mask.shape is (40, 64, 64)
```

These assertions are now untrue because Haxby dataset has been cropped.

``` python
In [16]: fmri_data.shape
Out[16]: (40, 49, 41, 1452)
```

We should propagate these modifications and make it a doctest or a real assertion to avoid further problems.
