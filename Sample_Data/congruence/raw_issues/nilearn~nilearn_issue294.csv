"issue_comment","294","nilearn","nilearn","lesteve","2014-11-25 15:07:17","Below is my summary of the compromise I gathered from the previous conversations. Please anyone shout if I misunderstood or misrepresented something:
1. Outside of _utils always use _img. In order to avoid ambiguities I am sincerely hoping that all the user-facing functions always accept Nifti-like images via calling _utils.check_img et al.
2. Inside _utils, make the difference between
   - _img: an object that has get_data and get_affine
   - _niimg: either a Nifti filename or an _img

So to take a few realistic examples:

``` python
# plotting/img_plotting.py

def plot_img(img):
    ""are we fine with the check_niimg(img) inconsistency here""
    img = check_niimg(img)  
    # rest of the code
```

``` python
# _utils/niimg_conversions.py

def check_niimg(niimg):
    # whatever the code does to check 'niimg' type 
    # and possibly convert the filename to an image

def is_img(img):
    # check that img has get_data and get_affine
```

The wording [there](http://nilearn.github.io/building_blocks/manipulating_mr_images.html#niimg-like-objects) seems to be ""Niimg-like object"". We could use this wording but I am not sure how to point to a useful description of what a Niimg-like object inside the docstring.
