2. If the dataset hasn't been downloaded yet, we are going to download it in the first download folder we can write to.
3. If we weren't able to create a subdirectory in any of the possible download folders, we want to raise an error with a summary of why it failed in each of the folder we tried.

Computing non-specific confounds on preprocessed image is dangerous, for
instance, as pointed out by Basile on Tuesday, the global signal mean
will contain strong traces of the resampling done in the realign step.

In terms of software design, when we integrate the HV confounds, I would
like to do this in terms of a transform, but that means that we need to
change the design of nilearn to take dictionaries for X, and that's a
much larger design work that we will undertake later.

If you need it for your own codebase, for instance because you don't have
access to the raw data, I suggest that you sublass the NiftiMasker that
you are using to add the functionality in your codebase. It should not be
hard to do the subclassing.

OK, based on my experience it works better when using the raw data.

Anyhow, as long as we haven't a clear idea on these choices, I am not
very enthousiastic at the idea of making high-level objects. I would like
to get empirical validation of the pipeline before implementing it in
nilearn before I am worried about the combinatorial explosion of options.

change the way we pass information in and out of objects before we
tackle this problem.

hold.

In contrast, on postprocessed images they might also take into account variance introduced during the alignment process. Physiologically induced confounds should be available both before and after preprocessing the data, so not sure whether that should make a big difference.

Regarding the for-loop, the idea is not to _shorten_ code for iteration though series of niftis but to _unify_ it. This can have at least two advantages:
a) Increase readability: using a generator (at least internally) allows for identical for loop bodies regardless of whether one is dealing with a list of paths, a list of Nifti1Image instances in 3D or a 4D NiftImage - perhaps the most recurrent forms of series of niftis.
b) Centralize and further standardize nifti access: several aspects need/can/should be checked in a majority of situations: verify nifti properties by check_niimg(), does file exist, _get_shape instead of get_shape(), _safe_get_data instead of get_data(). These and other routine calls could be built into the generator object. This could help enforce good-practice usage and boil the for loops down to the essential operation.

Regarding memory, the possibility of processing niftis one-by-one can also be realized in an easier fashion, of course, is only present for lists of paths, and is a mere side effect.

I think that the problem here is the ""continuous"" part (that should be ""nearest"" in your example). First, I think that reorder_img is a horrible name, reorder_axis would be more meaningful. Also, I don't see why a ""reordering"" function would completely change the affine.
I would split that into two low_level function: reorder_axis (or reorder_affine) and diagonalize_affine. And then, because diagonalize_affine would imply a resampling, then you don't need a ""resample_args"", it would be basically a wrapper around the resample function.

But to answer your question, if it is just about interpolation, I would go for a string parameter. `resample=True` would be equal to `resample='continuous'`. And you could put `resample='nearest'`. We could also imagine a `resample='auto'` which switches to nearest if all values are integers.

In this context it makes sense not to move all the imports at the beginning of the scripts but to use them when they are needed. I guess this way it looks more like an interactive session (or a tutorial) where the user imports packages when he needs them.

Yes. Also when a beginner is reading the script, he can more easily see

The other problem is that it a bit user-friendly on Linux, but we would end up with a folder in the AppData folder on windows and I think that most of users does not even know that it exists.

`l = ['mask.nii']` and `l2 = [nib.load('mask.nii')]` are 4D. By putting the mask in a list, you add a dimension.
`path = 'mask.nii'` and `nii = nib.load('mask.nii')` are 3D and thus are not accepted by check_niimgs, unless `accept_3d=True`.

2) Both parameters have been created for developer purposes. It avoids code repetition. `ensure_3d` is an assertion on the input data, whereas you can see `accept_3d` as a `atleast_4d` function for nifti images.

You did. And if I understand things correctly, you are saying that you
would want the code to throw an error. I think that this is a bad idea,
because depending on the software you a using, a same analysis can result
in a 3D or 4D (with shape[3] == 1) image. Typical, AFNI creates 4D
images. The users are not aware of these sublte differences, and making
the difference just for the sake of purity is not rendering them a
service.

However, a new pattern rises recently. An administrator may want to provide read-only data respository to people. In this case, nilearn won't work because, if a dataset is missing, the user does not have write access to the folder.

The solution would be to try other locations to store data if the first one does not work. We thought of allowing two environment variables (NILEARN_DATA and NILEARN_DATA_GLOBAL) or maybe allowing a list of paths in the environment variable, for example: NILEARN_DATA=/lab/data:/$HOME/my_data/

The scenario for me would be like this:

- Dataset is complete
  - Return it
- Dataset is incomplete
  - the dataset is in a writable directory -> download the rest of the dataset
  - the dataset is not in a writable directory -> raise an error saying to report this problem to admin.

Now we have to chose if we handle a path-like environement variable or if we have a global one and a local one.

No. It is important to me that we do not collide together nifti images
and arrays. If we start doing this, the API is going to become blurry.
In addition, supporting this uniformly would be ill-defined and
impossible to implement in a consistent way (ie which affine would be
used). It would make the package difficult to grasp and to use.

For the time being, my answer would be: buy more memory, or process your
images in patches.

We don't right now have the infrastructure to handle such a usecase.
Importantly, we shouldn't try to hack quick fixes, as they won't solve
much, but will make the code hard to handle. In the long run, we may
build an out-of-core handling infrastucture, but in the short term, you
should do loops over your images, and process them in batches.
