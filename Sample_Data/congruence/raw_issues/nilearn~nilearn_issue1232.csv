I decided to directly add an option in `coord_transform` instead of ""catching"" the problem in the searchlight because I think it may be useful for other usage.

Update:

For the bug fix: We have two masks in SearchLight: mask_img, that masks voxels outside of the brain and process_mask_img that ""selects"" the voxels to process. Before, mask_img was not used properly, process_mask_img was used instead. I fixed it.

"pull_request_commit_comment","1232","nilearn","nilearn","AlexandreAbraham","2016-08-09 09:37:44","I wondered. From a developper POV, this is indeed the most wanted behavior. From a user POV, being able to transform only one point is nice.

Another option I thought of is this:
`coord_transform(1, 2, 3, np.eye(4))` returns a 3-tuple `(1, 2, 3)`
and
`coord_transform([1], [2], [3], np.eye(4))` returns a 3-tuple of list `([1], [2], [3])`

Maybe this is more natural?

I don't think so. It's always annoying to have to deal with a number of
dimensions that can fluctuate.
