It would be nice if I get to use Python and Tornado as they are both my favorites :)

Also, does this library have mailing list and IRC? I only saw the G+ page.

If you would be interested in starting a Tornado OAuthLib integration similar to what @lepture is doing with [flask-oauthlib](https://github.com/lepture/flask-oauthlib) and @synasius is doing with [django-oauth-toolkit](https://github.com/evonove/django-oauth-toolkit) I'd be happy to help when time allows.

Closest thing to mailing list would be GitHub issues. Feel free to use issues to ask questions or post on the G+ page though. 

We do have IRC #oauthlib  on Freenode which I try to frequent during working hours CEST.
