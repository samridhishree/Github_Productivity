http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/connectivity/plot_ica_resting_state.html

The use the `plot_glass_brain` function on the resulting data:

``` python
from nilearn.plotting import plot_glass_brain

plot_glass_brain(nibabel.Nifti1Image(component_img.get_data()[:,:,:,12], 
                                  component_img.get_affine()),
                 threshold=1.5);
```

which yields:

This is not a bug in `plot_glass_brain` as the same shift can be observed with the `plot_stat_map` function when the background image is missing:

``` python
from nilearn.plotting import plot_stat_map

plot_stat_map(nibabel.Nifti1Image(component_img.get_data()[:,:,:,12], 
                                  component_img.get_affine()));
```

"issue_comment","330","nilearn","nilearn","lesteve","2015-01-05 12:18:14","Just wondering whether the data is supposed to be in MNI space. Here is  a snippet that shows that it doesn't seem to be the case:

``` python

from nilearn import datasets, plotting, image

nyu_dataset = datasets.fetch_nyu_rest(n_subjects=1)
func_filename = nyu_dataset.func[0]
mean_img = image.mean_img(func_filename)

cut_coords = (0, 0, 0)

plotting.plot_anat(title='MNI anat', cut_coords=cut_coords)
plotting.plot_anat(mean_img, title='mean_img',
                   cut_coords=cut_coords)
plotting.plot_anat(nyu_dataset.anat_anon[0], title='anat_anon',
                   cut_coords=cut_coords)
plotting.plot_anat(nyu_dataset.anat_skull[0], title='anat_skull',

That would be an option. I actually have such data on my disk. Let's make
this an ENH issue, and do it when we have time.
