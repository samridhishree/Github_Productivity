We're also conflating testdata.python2 and testdata.python3 into one folder, where small modifications were brought to the data files in order to work for both Python 2 and 3. The files with syntax errors though are generated dynamically.

@ceridwen let me know if this looks okay to you.

I tested it against rope, one of my own scripts, and snakefood, and none of them crash, so I think you resolved the problems.  I'd like to clean up the tox.ini with respect to coverage and MANIFEST.in, based on some things I learned from that horrible experience with Python's packaging tools, but I can do that after the merge.
