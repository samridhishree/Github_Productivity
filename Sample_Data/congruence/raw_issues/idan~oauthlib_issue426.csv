A customer now referenced the rfc, it states only the query component MAY be encoded. 

I think the check is too harsh because it MAY be encoded. 
Also the protocol part :// does not require encoding. 

First request is: the test should only issue a warning and not raise an exception. 
Second it should only check the query component.

I agree it should only check the query component though. I thought that's what it does.
