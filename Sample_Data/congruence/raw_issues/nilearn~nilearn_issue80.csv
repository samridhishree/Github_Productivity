```
        if isinstance(self.mask, NiftiMultiMasker) \
           and sklearn.externals.joblib.__version__.startswith(""0.6""):
            # Dirty workaround for a joblib bug
            # Memory with cachedir=None cannot be cloned in version 0.6
            # of joblib.
            masker_memory = self.mask.memory
            if masker_memory.cachedir is None:
                self.mask.memory = None
                self.masker_ = clone(self.mask)
                self.mask.memory = masker_memory
                self.masker_.memory = Memory(cachedir=None)
            else:
                self.masker_ = clone(self.mask)
            del masker_memory
        else:
            self.masker_ = clone(self.mask)
```

 but, unfortunately, this breaks Travis build:

```

I have made a dirty fix for the moment but we should fix this ASAP.

I don't understand. The memory shouldn't be cloned, only the masker. What
is the error message? Sorry, I am supposedly listening to talks, so I
cannot reproduce myself.

OK, I remember now.

OK, you can do a try/except on the cloning of the masker rather than
testing for version.

If the code inside the ""try"" branch is clean, that doesn't matter to me if what is in the ""except"" clause is ugly. Using a try/except by itself is not bad practice.
