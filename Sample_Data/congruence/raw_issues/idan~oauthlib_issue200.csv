"issue_comment","200","idan","oauthlib","squirly","2013-08-01 21:44:48","I have started doing this but am running into errors with the current implementation.

The current implementation expects that the library user will redirect the client to an error endpoint URL. This seems like a hack and I would never suggest doing this.

It would make more sense to immediately return a 400 error from the current view. In the current view you have the full exception and will be able to provide a better error. Also, it seems weird to not send anything but a 400 error to the user on a client error sending a 302 before returning an error page is very strange.

Regarding the redirect. It might not be the purest in REST terms but having a view dedicated to showing the error and redirecting rather than returning directly is hardly weird or a hack. It also makes it very clear in the example what the intended way to handle a FatalError is, i.e. display it to the user and not send the user back to client. That said I think it is perfectly fine to suggest to return an error view directly instead of redirecting, but ultimately it is up to the implementer and this is just an example.
