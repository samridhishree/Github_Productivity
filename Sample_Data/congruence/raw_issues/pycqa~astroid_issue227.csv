Actually the installation seems to be fine, so it's rather benign.

However, pylint doesn't like it:

This seems that you installed a under-development bookmark. Could you try to do a clone instead and before running python setup.py install, do a hg update @? That's the default bookmark which should be working under all conditions. Unfortunately pip doesn't handle this bookmark thingy properly. The problem with raw_building is actually from another under-development bookmark.
