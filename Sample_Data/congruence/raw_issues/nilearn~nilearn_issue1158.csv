Examples were updated accordingly (and became slightly less simple due to differences between the fetchers, but I don't see an obvious better way to do it), and a test `test_fail_fetch_haxby` for the dummy file download was added (which is just the ancient `test_fail_fetch_haxby_simple` with directories changed accordingly).

"pull_request_commit_comment","1158","nilearn","nilearn","Joaoloula","2016-07-03 09:04:35","You're right: I was so focused on getting the y vector the way it was on the simple fetcher, I forgot I could just take the conditions. 

I just commited the simplifications, except for `plot_haxby_mass_univariate`, that (at least the way it's coded now) requires both an unmasked conditions vector and a masked int-encoded one. Perhaps it's less problematic to keep it that way since it's supposed to be an advanced example. What do you think?

We should probably keep the old fetch_haxby_simple function for a little while, but flag it as deprecated, and remove it from the documentation.
