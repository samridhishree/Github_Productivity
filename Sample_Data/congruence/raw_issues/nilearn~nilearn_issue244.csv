# The problem

People often complain about nilearn data storage policy: by default datasets are stored in a ""nilearn_data"" folder created in the current directory. People are sometimes puzzled by the fact that, when they change directory, some examples download an already-downloaded dataset.
# Caveats
1. The number one problem is of disk space running out. In the home, it can have horrible consequences, because it tends to freeze many things. For example you may have a quota on your home folder that is easily overwhelmed by the size, roughly 5-10 GB, of the datasets.
2. Warnings, configuration options, ... are mostly useless, because the non-advanced users don't read/use them
# Proposed solution
- Use $HOME/nilearn_data by default
- In all the data downloaders:
  - capture the I/O errors that pop up when writing a file and that
      the disk is full
  - erase a bit of that half-written file (or all of it) to avoid
      leaving the disk full
  - raise an error clearly identifying the problem (disk full or
      quota blown) and suggesting solutions (the NILEARN_DATA
      variable + talk to your sysadmin).
