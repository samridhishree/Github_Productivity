I'm overlaying a functional map (fMRI) on an anatomical in the subject's space.  This displays fine with display_mode='ortho' as well as the axis pairs (eg.'xz')

but crashes in x,y,z with cut_coords > 1 and looks wrong even in the cut_coords=1 case:

Single axis cuts work fine using the MNI space data.  The command I'm using is below followed by the error.

Two other questions while I'm here:
1. is there a way of changing the transparency of the overlay that I've missed
2. is there a way of choosing the offset and spacing for the cuts in addition to the number of cuts for a single axis (x or y or z).

Thanks!
