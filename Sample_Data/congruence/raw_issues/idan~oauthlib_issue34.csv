oauth library depends on pycrypto library which is not pure Python library (has some c extensions). For this reason pycrypto can't be installed from source on Windows without Visual Studio 2008 installed (needed to compile these c extensions of pycrypto). The simplest solution is to download binary installers and install them using easy_install (pip doesn't support installing of binaries). 32bit binary installers for Python 2.2-2.7 and 64bit binary installer for Python 2.6 are at [The Voidspace Python Modules](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/modules.shtml#pycrypto) and 64bit binary installer for Python 2.7 is at [Compiling pycrypto on Win7-64](http://yorickdowne.wordpress.com/2010/12/22/compiling-pycrypto-on-win7-64/). Binary installers can be installed in virtualenv - see http://stackoverflow.com/q/3271590/95735
