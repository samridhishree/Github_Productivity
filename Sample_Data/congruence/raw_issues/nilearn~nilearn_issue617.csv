I was just looking for the very nice and thorough explanation on affine matrices and how they can be used to resample data that you had on your github.io documentation. It seems that the site has been restructured (very nice btw) and I can no longer find it. Not sure if you know what I am talking about but this was a very good document and I'd be happy if someone could point me to it.

Many thanks,
Seb

a lot of basics.

I tried to find it on archive.org to no avail. Maybe you can try yourself, especially if you happen to still know the old URL.
