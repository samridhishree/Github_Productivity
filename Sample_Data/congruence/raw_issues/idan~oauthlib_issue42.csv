PyCrypto will not be installed by default and users who want to sign requests using RSA will need to install it themselves. 

Added some lines about installing PyCrypto with the links supplied by @piotr-dobrogost (#34) to the client documentation.

Using restricted.io to avoid timeouts on travis builds (#26) as shown by @dstufft in #33. 

ps. sending this as a pull request so travis can scold me before merging =)

Just a note that pip supports extras now. So if you wanted to make it so that setup.py is still the one true source of everything that get's installed, you could just do:

```
pip install -i https://restricted.crate.io/ ""file://$PWD#egg=oauthlib[test]""
```

Which is basically the same as pip install ., but it also installs the test extra_requires.
