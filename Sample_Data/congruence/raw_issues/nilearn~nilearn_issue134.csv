On http://nilearn.github.io/data_analysis/resting_state_networks.html two links are given, labeled _left_img_ and _right_img_. My guess is that it was intended to have the figures inserted here
## Missing content

On http://nilearn.github.io/building_blocks/data_preparation.html#region paragraph _3.2.2.2. `NiftiMapsMasker` Usage_ one reads *Extracting region signals for several subjects can be performed like this:

my guess is that there is some source code missing here
