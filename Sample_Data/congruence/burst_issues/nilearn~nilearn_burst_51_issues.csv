6,issue_comment,277,nilearn,nilearn,banilo,2014-11-19 08:19:37,"Here's a use case: some time ago, we wanted to run summary analyses on the top of a bunch of previous quantitative meta-analyses published by different laboratories (project related to cognitive primitives). That is, there were niftis in different shapes as well as data in different representations (3D/4D), since everybody simply sent there data in the form they have the habit of processing it at their respective labs.

In this particular case, it would have been nice to rapidly get an overview of all the heterogeneous data by first getting everything into one 4D image in the same space to begin with.
More generally, I see the gain of concat_img in being able to collect niftis from heterogeneous origins/data processing cultures, including NeuroVault- or OpenfMRI-like sources.

I would say this is the wrong way around: _utils should be used by user-facing modules otherwise you'll increase your risk creating circular depencies. Maybe the simplest is to add the functionality to _utils and then just do `from _utils import concat_img` in image.py so that it is exposed to the user.

I agree on this one.

I think so and if we want a user-facing concat_img we just import it in nilearn.image something like:
`from .._utils import concat_img` this way it will be accessible as `nilearn.image.concat_img`

- If the cache location isn't already in the `.gitignore`, then git workflow can become messy (for example, using `git gui`).

I would like cache location to work like nilearn download/data location--to have a set of fallbacks for the Memory cache location:
- First, check for any explicit argument.
- If none, then use an environment variable value (e.g. `NILEARN_CACHE`).

I wonder if it's not something that we should worry about later.

Right now, my priority is to be able to teach a course on decoding and
functional connectivity to cognitive neuroscientist and that it flows
without any problem. Once we have this, we can iterate on providing more
value to user, including advanced user.

The Memory object is coming from joblib (shipped with scikit-learn) so I am not sure we want to change Memory directly. We could use a nilearn-specific thin wrapper around it that has the logic you mention. I would probably add a bullet point to your list in 3rd position: ~/nilearn_cache or something like this if there is no explicit argument and NILEARN_CACHE is not defined.

I didn't add that third bullet, because if we did that it would change the default behavior (which is not to cache results).  It would be easy to do either way.

So what I'm thinking is to have a thin wrapper around `joblib.Memory`, and all `nilearn` functions that receive `joblib.Memory` objects will simply default to the `nilearn` default (say, `nilearn._utils.cache_mixin.Memory`, or `nilearn._utils.cache_mixin.DefaultMemory`, rather than `Memory(cachedir=None)`

At this point, I also think the `nilearn._utils.cache_mixin` module is a bit overloaded; it's already used not just for the Mixin, but caching functions.  I would suggest to rename it simply to `nilearn._utils.cache` or `nilearn._utils.caching` when this change is made.

I think that this highly depends on your usage of nilearn. The most useful caching feature, I think, is in the masker (because masking can be long). If you put all cache into one single folder, it will be simply impossible to clear. If you mask 10 datasets, you won't be able to clear the data for one dataset only.

> - Searching the source tree becomes slow (as some search programs search all files for text)

Those are developers' concern, not really users'.

I am not fundamentally against having a `NILEARN_CACHE` directory. However, we need to find a solution to compartmentalize cache from different scripts. Otherwise I know what will happen: people will use this system, the folder will grow until it fills the hard drive, and then people will have to delete the whole thing and will lose everything.

What this enables is caching when you haven't explicitly set the cache--perhaps during script development and also nilearn testing--things that you would gladly have cached, and delete later.

None of the existing behavior changes (nothing is cached by default, and you can specify whatever Memory location you want); it just allows another capability (to cache by default to a common location, if you add an environment variable) that I am finding useful for myself.

It seems best to me to eliminate the idea that these args can be optional.  The codepath isn't used (and therefore not tested) anyway.

That would be a horrible misnomer. A seed is not necessary a ball. And
the ball is not always used for seeding (eg with graph analyses). While
the sphere/ball is a small misnomer, that one would be misleading.

Some cosmetics / potential benchmark questions:
- I'd use `np.concatenate([...], axis=0)` instead of `np.vstack` just to be clear what is being done
- apart from `np.tensordot`, there is also the option to just `reshape(4, -1)` and `np.dot` (probably faster). (And the slower option: `np.einsum`)
- [We may be able to transform the other way round, i.e. transform the seed into voxel space. For (up to permutation) symmetric 3x3 parts of the affine, we would then be able to just shrink or dilate along the principle axes and thus be able to use `ogrid`. But that is probably way to complicated for the simple generation of a mask]

Gaël suggested it and I did not change it on purpose. For the same reason, we used the word ""sphere"" instead of ""ball"" in the SearchLight code/documentation and the main feedback I had on this was ""but Searchlight uses balls, not spheres"". A sphere is a surface, a ball is a volume and people knows that. If you have a solution to make the name more serious, I'd like to know it, but I think that using ""sphere"" would be a mistake.

I'd say 3 examples: the 5-liner you mention, to catch people in, as the
glass brain is a clear selling point of the package, the current simple
example, and the current full example. The 5-liner would be on the
front page, but it would link (in the docstring) to the other examples.

I suggest changing the documentation until this is fixed.

Here are the issues I've found so far; I figured it's useful to document, and I'm willing to start migrating code (and getting Travis to run tests for 2.6 and 3.4), if that's cool.

Python 2.6:
- Using string.format() with ""{}"" (`nilearn/version.py`, `nilearn/plotting/plot_glass_brain.py`)
- Using dictionary comprehensions (`nilearn/plotting/plot_glass_brain.py`)
- Using `try... except Exception, e` syntax
- Use of `nose` `assert_x` functions that are 2.7+ (see https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html)
- `assert_raises` and `zipfile.ZipFile` are not context managers until 2.7+

Python 3+:
- Using `print ""string""` (vs. `print (""string"")`)
- Using `urllib` / `urllib2` (in dataset download logic & tests)
- Usage of `basestring` class (`nilearn/decomposition/multi_pca.py`)
- Improper absolute imports of nilearn packages used (`nilearn/decomposition/__init__.py`, `nilearn/_utils/niimg_conversions.py`)
- No `func_name` property available (`nilearn/_utils/cache_mixin.py`)
- Use of `xrange`
- Use of old-style octal literals (`0444` vs. `0o444`)

I hadn't realized that we didn't work under Python 2.6.

I agree that, as we are start to want more users, we should worry about

Here is the way that I suggest tackling this issue (thanks Ben for
stepping up): first (for Python 2.6), port the ideas in scikit-learn's
.travis.yml to have the tests running under 2.6, then get it running;
submit a PR. Once the PR is in, do the same for Python 3.0.

I am not sure you can use NEURODEBIAN=1 to work with python2.6.

Just saying I am not sure how Travis python version interacts with apt-get install python-numpy for example.

Maybe you have done that already but there is a way to set-up Travis so that it builds every time you are pushing into one of your branch, which is quite useful. Pandas developers page mentions this Travis [page](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/).

For nilearn._utils.testing.assert_raises_regexp, I actually copied the code from scikit-learn. The main reason I did that is [there](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/commit/a0c7693e0325dea9c7ce04a8512936eede881d32).

Good point, but supporting scikit-learn < 0.15 for users is different than supporting it for developers.  I think that, to avoid copying code and to use the full scikit-learn test functionality, it would be reasonable to require developers to use scikit-learn >= 0.15 (and show a meaningful error if they are not).

That doesn't seem to challenging to do... I'd be willing to make that happen if others are on-board with it.

Not sure where you would draw the line and which mechanism you would use. The thing is that Travis need to run the tests with old versions of scikit-learn so I don't really see how we can avoid providing an assert_raises_regexp inside nilearn.

Also as you might have seen from the link in my previous message there is a small but very nasty bug that is only fixed in scikit-learn master: assert_raises_regexp provided by scikit-learn is using match rather than search to check the error message. As far as I was concerned that was the last straw that broke the camel's back of my attempts at reusing scikit-learn assert_raises regexp.

Not sure if I've done something improperly, but during both `pip install` and the development cloning process, I had dependency errors.  I came back and saw the dependencies and resolved them manually.

Rather than declaring dependencies in the `README.md` file, what about declaring in a `requirements.txt` file? ([documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide.html#requirements-files)).

This should allow `pip` to resolve dependencies when installing the package, and should make getting the development version after cloning `nilearn` up and running more easily.

We could also have defined the dependencies in setup.py. The thing is that for example numpy needs to be compiled from source when using pip install. This compilation step is likely to fail (for example because you don't have the package with the required C headers on Linux, or even more likely on Windows where most of our users don't have any C compiler installed) 

Basically we are strongly encouraging users to install numpy, scipy and scikit-learn via their OS package managers on Linux or Anaconda on Windows and OSX.

Glad to look into how to accomplish this in a `setup.py` file (sounds like a `requirements.txt` file may not be flexible enough to accomplish the above), if that sounds like a reasonable direction.

Maybe shooting a warning (or an error) in the setup.py would be a good
way to do this.

To do this, we should probably move the '_check_dependencies' out from
nilearn/__init__.py to nilearn.version and 'import' it in the setup.py as
the version number is currently imported.

I think that we would accept a PR (pull request) doing that.
Unfortunately, I'll be offline for 2 weeks starting tomorrow. So I cannot
review it, but maybe other people of the nilearn team will be able to.

I think the general idea has legs but needs to be tweaked a bit. The caveat is that you don't want to throw when nibabel is not installed in setup.py because setup.py is supposed to install it.

Also it'd be good to check what setup.py install error exactly looks like, to make sure we get an error that is actually helpful.

Good point. That means that you probably need to have a keyword argument
in the dependency checker.

Also, we should raise an error only if an install is asked, and not other
options.

1,issue_title,349,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2015-01-14 08:06:54,"The documentation states that a Niimg is `any object exposing get_data() and get_affine() methods, for instance a Nifti1Image from nibabel`. This is false as some parts of the code were made with Nifti1Image in mind. For example, using an object exposing the right methods but also `__iter__()` will make `check_niimg` fail.

Example iterable object:

``` python
import numpy as np
from nilearn._utils.niimg_conversions import check_niimg


class Niimg(object):

    def get_data(self):
        return np.ones((10, 10, 10, 5))

    def get_affine(self):
        return np.eye(4)

    def __iter__(self):
        for i in range(5):
            yield np.ones((10, 10, 10))

check_niimg(Niimg())
```

Commenting this code in niimg_conversions makes it work. In fact, we can't make assumptions on the data based on the presence of an `__iter__` method.

``` python
    if hasattr(niimg, ""__iter__""):
        pass
        #if ensure_3d:
        #    raise TypeError(""A 3D image is expected, but an iterable was""
        #        "" given: %s"" % short_repr(niimg))
        #if hasattr(niimg, ""__len__"") and len(niimg) == 0:
        #    raise TypeError('An empty object - %r - was passed instead of an '
        #                    'image or a list of images' % niimg)
        #return concat_niimgs(niimg)
```

This code has to be replaced by proper checks, and we should maybe make a pass on the code to be sure that it does not happen elsewhere.

Good point indeed. We can specify that the inverse transform always
return the data in the space of the atlas unless an explicit affine is
passed. These are consitent semantics (in the sens that they offer little
surprises). They may lead to memory explosions, but note that
inverse_transform will be used by much less people than transform (it is
a less common case). Also, the memory explosion is more obvious because
it occurs via the size of the output created by the function. In the
current case, it is harder to guess, as it occurs in an intermediate
variable.

``` python
masker = NiftiLabelsMasker(labels_img, resample_target='data')
masker.fit()

# First dataset, target_affine is set to affine_data_1
data1 = masker.transform(dataset1)

# Second dataset, target_affine is set to affine_data_2
data2 = masker.transform(dataset2)

# Inverse transform, my data has been resampled into dataset2 space
masker.inverse_transform(data1)
```

We could say that the affine is defined on the first transform, but I find this misleading. We could also say that the `target_affine` is defined by the data given in the `fit` but it would conflict with mask computation and also be misleading compared to the behavior of the classical NiftiMasker.

The problem is not the `transform` step, it is the `inverse_transform`. If resampling is done on heterogenous data, how do we chose the affine when `inverse_transforming`? For me, it is better to explicitely give an affine (or a niimg which has the desired affine).

I think we can consider resampling the atlas as costless. Given that masking is usually done once and cached, it doesn't bother me if there is a small overhead per process.

**Expectation:**
- It is possible to completely turn off output.

**Current behavior:**
- A number of dataset download functions print, even at `verbosity=0`

**Notes:**
Currently, the tests print a lot of output during testing.  This makes viewing test output very challenging--I have to search/scroll for error information, and even getting to the final output requires a lot of scrolling.

**Proposed solutions:**
Either:
- Define a schema for what verbosity means (0=silent, 1=errors, 2=warnings, 3=standard user output, 4=debug info, etc.), and use it

or
- Instead of passing a verbosity, pass a logger from the `logging` module.
- Create a `nilearn._utils.logger` object in the `nilearn._utils.__init__' file, that will be the default logger.

I would prefer the second solution; I think anyone wanting to actually manipulate the logging would either know the `logging` module, or would ""get"" it pretty quickly (it's not hard)

Again, this is a developer-side feature that I'm happy to implement in order to make my own life easier.

Agreed.

This is wrong and should not be like this, indeed (but for long-running
function, default should be to print some sane progress, and thus default
should not be verbose=0).

>   • Define a schema for what verbosity means (0=silent, 1=errors,
>   2=warnings, 3 =standard user output, 4=debug info, etc.), and use it

Well, this is the standard logging behavior in Python, but this is not
what we want, as we want also an indication of progress. verbosity=1
should display a bit of progress, verbosity=2 more,... This is important
when running a lot of computation/long run jobs. Also, we use a pattern
of decreasing verbosity when combining methods one into the other. That
way the progress of each nested for loop can always be seen.

Also, warnings and errors should always be displayed unless they are
absolutely harmless. We need user to see these.

> I would prefer the second solution; I think anyone wanting to actually

This is not the way I see it. Only geeks know the logger module. Beside,
it does not implement well the pattern of decreasing verbosity, which is
really useful.

Definitely.

For those that are not right. But when you do this, check that the
default verbosity is still meaningful, ie that long-running operations
still print a bit of progress by default.

**Summary:**
Previously, dependency checks were defined inside `__init__.py`.  I've:
- Moved the dependency check code to `version.py`
- Called the code from `__init__.py` and `setup.py`

This required some additional tweaks:
- Add metadata about which modules must be installed manually.
- Do slightly different dependency checks pre-setup (when we only need to check modules requiring manual installation) and post-setup (where we should check all modules).

There were a few other tiny tweaks I made, that I'll document inline.

 **Testing:**
- I tested that `nilearn` installs properly when all dependencies are installed
- I tested that `nilearn` fails with an error message if one of the `manual_only` modules is not installed (in my case, `sklearn`)

Shit. I missed that. AFAICT it was added by @lesteve in decembre.

This is really a no-no. Using setuptools makes installs be eggs, which
circumvent the normal Python import mechanisms and has many detrimental
consequences [*]. We should not be using setuptools. Besides, this adds a
dependency (setuptools is not in the standard library).

Yes. This has been a long running argument. It brings certain good
things, and has benefits.

As long as it is not in the standard library, I am against using it. The
reason it has never made in the standard library, although it has strong
proponents, is that it has never met the quality standards corresponding
to the standard library. Unlike pip, which is now in the standard library
for Python 3.5. It is improving, though, and I am hopeful that something
good will come out of it. However, in the mean time, I think that we can
stick to distutils.

Yes! Agreed.

That's a benefit benefit indeed. Setuptools do bring benefits.

OK. Yes, this makes sens. That's the way it should be. In now way the
install mechanism of setuptools should be used. Setuptools should be used
for operations that cannot be done with distutils.

I'd really like to stress that while there are benefits, setuptools has
historically been very controversial, because it made choices that had
wide reaching impacts on the import mechanisms and the installation of
packages. There is a reason for which after 10 years it is not in the
standard library.

Installation is something that we really want robust and reliable. We do
not want to be making it brittle.

a) using input images that have bad affines can cause segmentation faults, quitting python directly

b) using interpolation=nearest can cause ""completely messed up"" niftis, similar to the recent resample_img bug related to endianess

c) comparing 4d niftis before and after resampling in FSLView, in one case, turned out to look fine for the first 500 images, yet resulted in rather different histogramms in images in the second 500 volumes

I will try to provide python scripts reproducing these things and the corresponding data.

I propose this outline:
1. What do you use in nilearn?
2. What problems did you encounter? Did you find a workaround by yourself?
3. What do you want to see in nilearn in the future
4. Comments on nilearn in general (what you like / don't like...)
# What do you use in nilearn?
- `_utils.check_niimg`
- `NiftiMasker`
- `plotting.*`
- `datasets.*`
# What problems did you encounter? Did you find a workaround by yourself?
## CanICA

Given my pipeline, it was more practical for me to use CanICA directly on masked data. To do that, I copied the code in my repo and remove all that was related to masking. I tried to give a fake mask to use it (of shape `(n_voxels, 1, 1)`) but Nifti1Image does not allow it.

After Andres' presentation, I wanted to try using Ward to compress data before ICA and compare it to a simple smoothing. Again, I can't do that in nilearn: NiftiLabelsMasker are not accepted in CanICA.
## MultiNiftiMasker

I don't find the caching system of the MultiNiftiMasker practical. Therefore I use a NiftiMasker with a loop and I cache the data myself. But this is specific to my needs since I move the data on several machines.
## Nifti1Image

This class is horrible. I created my own Niimg class a while ago. It supports indexing, iteration, and modification. It also does a bit more (like on the fly unmasking and weak references) but this is more specific to my usage. It also contains the id of the subject which is helpful to retrieve phenotypic information for example.
# What do you want to see in nilearn in the future

I am very enthuastic about some upcoming plotting features. This is really useful. We are also on our way to integrate new models which is definitely a big plus for reproducible science. I'm also waiting for the report features and notebook examples.
# Comments on nilearn in general (what you like / don't like...)

I am a bit frightened about the growth of the maskers in term of functionalities (time masking) and types (balls masker). In fact, adding options and increasing their number may lead to maintenance issues as each one has its own implementation.
And in general, the most annoying thing is to have to import nibabel and create a new Nifti1Image everytime I need to modify something in the data.

I used NiftiMapsMasker and datasets.
**What problems did you encounter? Did you find a workaround by yourself?**
From my naive point of view as a beginner in programming, I am frustrated with joblib. I rerun the Masker with different parameters without specifying different memory locations and I end up with a huge memory size of a series of files I never exploited because I don't know to which subject/set of parameters they correspond. Plus I had to move the root folder containing joblib and I had the impression that the cached files were no longer recognized.
A different minor point is that I wanted to explore non standardized signals within my ROIs but the function signal.clean forces normalization of the input signals. I'm rather used to scaling the signal to its average across timepoints (PSC units). 
**What do you want to see in nilearn in the future**
I would like to have a hrf so that to deal with connectivity during task.
**Comments on nilearn in general (what you like / don't like...)**
I like in nilearn the excellent code quality: one can go into it and understand quickly what it does. But I feel like in the user guide and the given examples the stress is put on the model but not on the neuro point of view. For instance I expect regions or at least networks to be explicit on a connectivity matrix plot for real data.

 NiftiMasker (mostly), visualization; get back to the examples when running clustering, ICA etc.

_What problems did you encounter? Did you find a workaround by yourself?_
Most of them have been fixed in the course of time. 

_What do you want to see in nilearn in the future_
I'd like to see it become a complete suite for volume-based (as opposed to surface-based) data analysis: design matrix, GLM, group statistics.
Up-to-date dictionary learning.

5,issue_comment,361,nilearn,nilearn,eickenberg,2015-01-27 13:13:27,"## What do you use in nilearn?
- `_utils.check_niimg`
- resampling / cropping functionality
- `NiftiMasker`
- `plotting._plot_img_with_bg` ;) (but other ones, too, of course)
- `datasets` fetchers!

## What problems?
- This is probably overfitting the Haxby2001 dataset usecase, but neither `NiftiMasker` nor `MultiNiftiMasker` are appropriate here, since `NiftiMasker` cannot set breakpoints for detrending and standardizing and `MultiNiftiMasker` needs different `niimgs` to do it. Potential solution: When slicing `niimgs` becomes possible, one could use the `MultiNiftiMasker` with slices
- `plotting.plot_img`, the ""general"" plotting function is not a functional superset of `plotting.plot_stat_map` (no background possible IIRC)
- `NiftiMasker.mask_strategy` is somehow always the wrong one for the data I want to treat ;)
- not a problem if handled correctly: nilearn should not overfit usecases or become an eclectic collection of not universally accepted tools. Right now everything is OK.

## Future?
- GLM, please! In a way that can read onset descriptor files but doesn't oblige me to use them. Minimum amount of classes involved (e.g. ideally 0 or 1, implementing a transformer type interface).
- Interactive plotting would to me be worth its number of lines in gold units. Every time I plot a stat map, I want to scroll around, but can't. This could be done with `pynax` in the slimmest possible way.

I think that's the point: you never needed it so you never paid attention. But when you want to know (typically when you have a slow connection), having false information is very annoying. And this is not an edge case: when downloading a big dataset, I put my computer to sleep a lot (I do it 3 times a day: when commuting and when sleeping). Also, when I wanted to get my bandwith back temporary, I paused the process using Ctrl + Z, this also invalidate estimated time. Because of that, I ended up using wget instead of nilearn.
But I agree: this solution is not optimal (I thought that uptime was a standard module as it was installed on my box) and this is not the most important bug. Do we have a solution that can be coded fast and solve this problem ?

Maybe, but we are speculating on the future. Who knows how the resources
to maintain nilearn are going to evolve, and how the demand is going to
evolve. Right now, we are a small team, and I am afraid that the
complexity of the download code is starting to become disproportionate to
its usefulness. Importantly, the priority of nilearn is to be useful to
neuroimaging and we need to invest best our efforts to find the simplest
way to achieve this goal.

Implement a residual time based on a local speed of download. Or simply
move on.

If so, the first commit contains the original changes and none of this uptime stuff.  Perhaps it can be cherry-picked into master?  Or do you prefer I force the change to my branch, so we can merge here?
