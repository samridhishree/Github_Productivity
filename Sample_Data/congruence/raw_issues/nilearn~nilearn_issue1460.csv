Not sure how to interpret this result when calling fit_transform(timeseries):

1.  I extract the time series for the DMN 
dim_coords = {label[0]:(0, -52, 18),label[1]:(-46, -68, 32), label[2]:(46, -68, 32),label[3]:(1, 50, -5)}
I got 0 correlation matrix
[[ 1.  0. -0. -0.]
 [ 0.  1. -0. -0.]
 [-0. -0.  1. -0.]
 [-0. -0. -0.  1.]]

2. If I change ONLY the second seed, which is now equal to the first seed, all the rest equal
dim_coords = {label[0]:(0, -52, 18),label[1]:(0, -52, 18), label[2]:(46, -68, 32),label[3]:(1, 50, -5)} 
I get this correlation matrix, how can be this possible?

I will rephrase the problem: I have 4 seeds s={s1,s2,s3, s4}  get the time series and  connectivity_measure.fit_transform(ts) returns the identity matrix (no correlation between pairs of seeds found)

But, If I change one seed, let us say, s2 for s5, now the connectivity_measure.fit_transform(ts)  for {s1,s5,s3, s4} returns a matrix with correlation >0 between pairs. How can be possible that the correlation between, for example, s1 and s4 is 0 in the first case and and .3 in the second case??

I am not sure how to interpret the shrinkage for the Leit covariance estimator. What does it say about the time series covariance? I wonder if there is a way to compute the optimal
shrinkage intensity","",""

I've found the shrinkage = 1.0

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.covariance import LedoitWolf, EmpiricalCovariance

X = np.loadtxt('/tmp/timeseries.txt')
cov = EmpiricalCovariance(assume_centered=True)
cov.fit(X)
print(cov.covariance_)

lw = LedoitWolf(assume_centered=True)
lw.fit(X)
print(lw.covariance_)
print('shrinkage = %.4f' % lw.shrinkage_)
