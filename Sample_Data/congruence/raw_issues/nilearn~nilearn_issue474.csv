https://coveralls.io/builds/1973818/source?filename=nilearn%2Finput_data%2Fnifti_masker.py

It pointed out that an error case was not covered, nor was computation via the ""epi"" `mask_strategy` option.

I added tests for both (with epi tests based on those in `test_masking`), and added a small bugfix that I found after adding the tests.
