### Changelog
> 
>### 3.0.8

>==================

>* Change capture.py&#39;s ``DontReadFromInput`` class to throw ``io.UnsupportedOperation`` errors rather
>  than ValueErrors in the ``fileno`` method (`2276`_).
>  Thanks `metasyn`_ for the PR.

>* Fix exception formatting while importing modules when the exception message
>  contains non-ascii characters (`2336`_).
>  Thanks `fabioz`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.
>  
>* Added documentation related to issue (`1937`_)
>  Thanks `skylarjhdownes`_ for the PR.

>* Allow collecting files with any file extension as Python modules (`2369`_).
>  Thanks `Kodiologist`_ for the PR.

>* Show the correct error message when collect &quot;parametrize&quot; func with wrong args (`2383`_).
