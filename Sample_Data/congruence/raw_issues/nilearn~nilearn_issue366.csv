"issue_title","366","nilearn","nilearn","bcipolli","2015-01-22 18:18:08","Another developer-focused code change that I found I needed when doing Python 2.6 / Python 3.x support.

**Expectation:**
- It is possible to completely turn off output.

**Current behavior:**
- A number of dataset download functions print, even at `verbosity=0`

**Notes:**
Currently, the tests print a lot of output during testing.  This makes viewing test output very challenging--I have to search/scroll for error information, and even getting to the final output requires a lot of scrolling.

**Proposed solutions:**
Either:
- Define a schema for what verbosity means (0=silent, 1=errors, 2=warnings, 3=standard user output, 4=debug info, etc.), and use it

or
- Instead of passing a verbosity, pass a logger from the `logging` module.
- Create a `nilearn._utils.logger` object in the `nilearn._utils.__init__' file, that will be the default logger.

I would prefer the second solution; I think anyone wanting to actually manipulate the logging would either know the `logging` module, or would ""get"" it pretty quickly (it's not hard)

Again, this is a developer-side feature that I'm happy to implement in order to make my own life easier.

Agreed.

>   • A number of dataset download functions print, even at verbosity=0

This is wrong and should not be like this, indeed (but for long-running
function, default should be to print some sane progress, and thus default
should not be verbose=0).

Well, this is the standard logging behavior in Python, but this is not
what we want, as we want also an indication of progress. verbosity=1
should display a bit of progress, verbosity=2 more,... This is important
when running a lot of computation/long run jobs. Also, we use a pattern
of decreasing verbosity when combining methods one into the other. That
way the progress of each nested for loop can always be seen.

Also, warnings and errors should always be displayed unless they are
absolutely harmless. We need user to see these.

This is not the way I see it. Only geeks know the logger module. Beside,
it does not implement well the pattern of decreasing verbosity, which is
really useful.

Definitely.

>   • Increment all other verbosity checks by one.

For those that are not right. But when you do this, check that the
default verbosity is still meaningful, ie that long-running operations
still print a bit of progress by default.

Granted. It just requires touching the same lines, and thus would raise
conflicts in version control if dealt with in parallel.

We do not want to be using this by default in the continuous integration,
as it does swallow useful info.

The right path indeed is to clean up verbosity. This is definitely
useful.

"issue_comment","366","nilearn","nilearn","bcipolli","2015-01-24 14:05:59","OK, so the change I propose is:
- Make any `print` that isn't currently within an `if verbosity > ...` statement check for `verbosity > 0`
- Increment all other verbosity checks by one.

That seems like the simplest change.  Glad to hear if something more complex is desired.

Need to address this issue, to complete the `Python 3.x` support.

Sure but what I don't understand is why Python 3 support would be dependent on this issue.
