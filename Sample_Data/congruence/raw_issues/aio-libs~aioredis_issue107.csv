"issue_comment","107","aio-libs","aioredis","Abdeljelil","2016-11-01 16:00:28","Hi, 
I tried a simple example to test sentinel with asyncio and I have this error when I try to call discover_master method. Is it a bug ?

File ""/lib/python3.5/site-packages/aioredis/sentinel.py"", line 251, in discover_master
    masters = yield from sentinel.sentinel_masters()
AttributeError: 'Redis' object has no attribute 'sentinel_masters'

This is my example:

``` python
@asyncio.coroutine
def get_master_redis(loop, replication):

    redis_sentinel = yield from aioredis.create_sentinel(
        nodes, loop=loop
        )

    master = yield from redis_sentinel.discover_master(replication)

    return master
```
