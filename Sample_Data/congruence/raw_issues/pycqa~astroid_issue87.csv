The way we inspect gi modules can trigger python-gobject deprecation
warnings. At least on Fedora 22 this is very noisy with a ton of
warnings right after running pylint on gi using code.

Silence the specific pygi deprecation warnings.

(sorry, tried to submit a pull request but my local mercurial or git-remote-hg is falling over, so patch attached)
