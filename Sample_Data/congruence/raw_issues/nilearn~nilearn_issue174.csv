resample_img will not calculate a new bounding box for the data and will keep exactly the same shape as the original data. This leads, in several cases I have had, to completely empty views on the data. A test will follow.

Proposition:
Act similarly to resample_img given a 3D affine. In this case, this coordinate origin is unknown and nilearn calculates a bounding box around the data and sets the new origin to one corner of this box.
Given a 4D affine, resample_img should also recalculate a bounding box in order to be sure to contain the full data that were to be transformed. However, the coordinate origin should be adopted from the given affine.

How does this sound?
