```
In [8]:

from nisl import datasets
haxby_data = datasets.fetch_haxby()
# The data is then already loaded as numpy arrays:
haxby_data.keys() 
haxby_data.data.shape
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-8-6127e8737e4d> in <module>()
      3 # The data is then already loaded as numpy arrays:
      4 haxby_data.keys()
----> 5 haxby_data.data.shape

AttributeError: 'Bunch' object has no attribute 'data'
```

That's because in fact, the `haxby_data` object has different fields from what the docs say:

```
In [9]:

haxby_data
Out[9]:
{'conditions_target': '/home/fperez/talks/slides/1210_pycon_canada/nisl_data/haxby2001/pymvpa-exampledata/attributes_literal.txt',
 'func': '/home/fperez/talks/slides/1210_pycon_canada/nisl_data/haxby2001/pymvpa-exampledata/bold.nii.gz',
 'mask': '/home/fperez/talks/slides/1210_pycon_canada/nisl_data/haxby2001/pymvpa-exampledata/mask.nii.gz',
 'session_target': '/home/fperez/talks/slides/1210_pycon_canada/nisl_data/haxby2001/pymvpa-exampledata/attributes.txt'}
```

Unfortunately I need to run out to catch a flight and can't debug this one now, but I figured at least I'd report it... This is running on a fresh install of nisl from just a moment ago.

The webpage might be out of date compared to the github repo. The github repo has been undergoing quite a few changes lately, with @AlexandreAbraham writing a few more helpers to make the examples cleaner. I hope to update the webpage soon. In the mean time, you can use the docs that come with the git repo. Hopefully, the are up to date. If not, please do report problems.

Thanks a lot for the report.

We absolutely welcome feedback. I just wanted to apologize for the state of things.

How, we have to make sure that our docs are doc-tested.
