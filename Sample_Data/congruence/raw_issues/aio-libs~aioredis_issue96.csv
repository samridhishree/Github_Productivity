"issue_comment","96","aio-libs","aioredis","popravich","2015-11-04 16:48:28","Its a tricky question.
decoding is good, but you can construct `SORT` to get keys and values by reference
and what if you don't want to decode part of keys or
there may be more keys causing decode errors slowing response processing...
I don't see simple solution right now.

"issue_comment","96","aio-libs","aioredis","asvetlov","2015-11-04 20:05:29","Good point. Actually we need a bunch of encoders -- first for _key_ and encoders for every _get_patterns_. 
Final method signature becomes a mess easy.
Feel free to close as WontFix if you agree.
