Reproducing with this code. In this case, b can be inferred as an empty list, but the code instead raises an InferenceError when it gets to analyze it.

```
#!python

from astroid.test_utils import extract_node
n = extract_node('''
a, *b, c = 1, 2
b #@
''')
print(next(n.infer()))
```

Fix a bug in the inference of Starred nodes

This bug occurs when the left hand side of an assignment has an extra element
comparing with the right hand side, which makes the Starred node to not be inferred
correctly as an empty List. Closes issue #239.
