We could also use an additional variable like `non_resting_state_mask = np.logical_not(resting_state)` because resting_state == False is used quite a few times in the examples:

Examples affected by this:

That's onlny because you know C (or matlab, actually). To a layman, it's
not readable at all. I like to push people to use np.logical_not in the
codebase.
