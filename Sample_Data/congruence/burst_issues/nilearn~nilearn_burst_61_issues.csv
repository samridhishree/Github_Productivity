@arthurmensch about the original technical issue, I tried to reproduce the problem in Python 2.6 and I couldn't:

Do you have a particular example of an object for which this fails?

There is an iterator to iterate on non-first dimensions, it is `np.nested_iters`. However this is not the fastest solution, transposing the axes is even faster. It has to be noted that, for that particular purpose, a `nditer` may be the faster solution because it would iter on both arrays at the same time.

Here is a small bench to convince you.

``` python
import numpy as np
import time


a = np.random.random((20, 30, 40, 5, 6))

t0 = time.time()
for i in range(100):
    all_img = (slice(None), ) * 3
    other_shape = a.shape[3:]
    for ind in np.ndindex(*other_shape):
        a[all_img + ind].shape
print time.time() - t0

t0 = time.time()
for i in range(100):
    it0, it1 = np.nested_iters(a, [range(3, a.ndim), [0, 1, 2]], flags=['multi_index'])
    for x in it0:
        it1.itviews[0].shape
print time.time() - t0

t0 = time.time()
for i in range(100):
    other_shape = a.shape[3:]
    b = np.transpose(a, range(3, a.ndim) + [0, 1, 2])

I think we should follow the same convention for all atlases.

This is misleading: your atlas cannot be trated by NiftiMapsMasker, it should be fed to NiftiLabelsMasker.

> some return directly a nibable.Niftiimage while others return the file name

When a Nifti1Image is returned, it is probably that some processing of the atlas was required. However, this doesn't matter as both are niimgs and can be processed by all nilearn functions.

> some just return a list while I am returning a dictionary

Well, a list can be seen as an ""int to string"" dictionary :P. I think that we should return dictionaries everywhere.

> Should this be reported as an issue?

Yes! We definitely need to harmonize the naming conventions and return types. However, I have no time to do it. Let's merge your PR and then solve the problem of the naming.

About adding the hyphen in front of each line, have you checked how it renders in the html API reference documentation? Personally I wouldn't bother doing that in this PR. In case there is a neat improvement in term of html rendering, you would need to do that consistently for all the fetch_\* functions.

Actually the file structure is so different between versions that it might be better to just have them in separate fetch functions.

Then the parameter would be used also to create the dataset folder with the version attached, nonetheless I think it would be misleading for a user to have the parameter in the function exposed when at the moment there is no download of other versions, so maybe we would also need to point out in the docs that other versions are not downloadable yet?
