I guess this should be _nilearn_. No ?

@GaelVaroquaux @AlexandreAbraham any opinions on this?

Citing scikit-learn in place of nilearn (for what ever reason) is really hard to understand. Can someone throw light on this ?

There is no citation for nilearn. This is why we left the message pushing
people to cite scikit-learn. I would leave it like this, until we have a
citation for nilearn. Right now, it is not even a released software.
