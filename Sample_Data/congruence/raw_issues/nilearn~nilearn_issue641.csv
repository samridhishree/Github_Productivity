First, note that the doc string of NiftiMapsMasker is a bit misleading: 

maps_img: Niimg-like object
    Region definitions, as one image of labels.

This seems copied from NiftiLabelsMasker, no?

Second, my code incidently tried to use a NiftiMapsMasker to extract data in a single ROI, that is with a single image in maps_roi.

This yielded the following error: 

```

    170     if ensure_ndim is not None and len(niimg.shape) != ensure_ndim:

DimensionError: Data must be a 4D Niimg-like object but you provided a 3D image. See http://nilearn.github.io/building_blocks/manipulating_mr_images.html#niimg.
```

Why not allow a single map?
Well, I will use  'apply_mask'...

`NiftiMapsMasker([my_single_map])`

We prohibit single images because we are afraid that people use it in the wrong way.

Thanks for spotting the documentation problem!
