"issue_comment","485","idan","oauthlib","duaneking","2017-10-18 22:11:52","How would I best help out?

I'm interested in getting this working for many reasons, both professional and personal, and I have - as of 11am Seattle time today - sign off from my CTO at my ""day job"" to use limited work time to make bug fixes and other improvements that can be merged upstream in order to assist in our professional use of the oauthlib and flask-oauthlib libraries, if it is indeed the pair we standardize on.

If however, I'm not able to get something simple working by the end of the week, I may be asked to do our project in GOLANG and that would preclude my being allowed to assist this project with the professional resources and support I could otherwise bring.

I have not been able to get anything working with the libraries yet, due to the issues already reported.  #490 #463, etc.  

If the current maintainers - @thedrow @lepture etc included - are willing to assist in getting the blockers fixed so I can show a simple demo and prove out the library to my executive, I may be able to get finish getting my company to provide me the time to start in and help out where I can with changes that we can all merge upstream to the benefit of the entire Python community.  I'm sure it will mean I need to ramp up on the code, etc, but I have already printed out the RFC's and I need to learn this stuff anyway for work, so my thinking it this could help a lot of people out and solve multiple problems at once.","",""
"issue_comment","485","idan","oauthlib","lepture","2017-10-19 00:25:08","What we need is not more maintainers, but a main maintainer.

This project is still under the account of @idan, but he hasn't been maintaining this project. It would be good to move this project to an org. We can use https://opencollective.com/ to collect donations so that contributors can spare more time.","",""
"issue_comment","485","idan","oauthlib","duaneking","2017-10-19 01:44:48","I thought @lepture was the main maintainer?  Or at least, that's how it looks to me as a random developer looking in. ;)

I agree an org is important.  I'm able to get my company to sign off on some work. but really any professional time I would be allowed to put in would be to fix issues and allow it to be more useful to people who don't want to use an expensive third party like Auth0 to be an identity provider.  The rest would be me donating time of my own.

Do we have a way to assure @idan is in good health or otherwise just not busy?  I would hate to roll in and just assume, etc.

That said, I would be happy to help if I can.  One issue I can think of is the official package release system. Would that be lost?

I'm wondering if its a version issue.  I was trying to roll back versions more and more last night hoping for a working example if I hit the right combination of versions.. but that has not happened yet and I have rolled back/pinned all the versions I can think of.

The examples only get me as far as the initial auth token set in the session/shown on the page, all attempts to auth the remove.get(me) call on the client->server client side call side fail yet there is no debugging output or help as to why.","",""
