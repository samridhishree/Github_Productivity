Got it: the resulting z variate is not a standard normal -- it actually requires some rescaling.
OK, that's fine with me.

By contrast, a z value of 0.3 is very low, basically chance level. You probably want z values greater than 2. This being said, I realize that nothing survives at a threshold of 2.
A threshold of 1 only outlines the PCC. ","86d8e73edc6540d8be08a082cedf1ca1509e83cb","(14, '', u'examples/03_connectivity/plot_seed_to_voxel_correlation.py')"

"pull_request_commit_comment","1465","nilearn","nilearn","TheChymera","2017-06-14 15:13:58","On my own data, a threshold of 0.1 seems more appropriate, and gives me really clear-cut examples looking nothing at all like randomness (see below) - and highly reproducible between subjects and sessions.

I am using what is basically [the code from the example](https://github.com/IBT-FMI/SAMRI/blob/master/samri/pipelines/fc.py#L167).

Is it possible that the computation is incomplete?
