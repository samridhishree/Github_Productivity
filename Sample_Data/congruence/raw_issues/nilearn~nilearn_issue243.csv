On my way of fixing it again, I added a test to `check_niimg` and tweaked an error message. I thought I would do a pull request to justify wasting my time.

"pull_request_commit_comment","243","nilearn","nilearn","lesteve","2014-09-23 13:37:10","Just wondering whether this test was supposed to use `data_img` rather than `data` and be pretty much identical to the test I just added. Here `data` is a numpy array, and you get an error like ""a 3D image is expected but an iterable was given"", which is good enough to make the test pass.
