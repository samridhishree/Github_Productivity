<pre>
from nilearn import datasets

localizer_dataset = datasets.fetch_localizer_button_task()
localizer_tmap_filename = localizer_dataset.tmaps[0]

from nilearn import plotting
glass_brain = plotting.plot_glass_brain(None)

glass_brain.add_contours(localizer_tmap_filename, filled=True,
                         levels=[3, ], colors=['g', ], alpha=1)
</pre>


This doesn't run if I don't specify colors and alpha. It does if I don't use filled=True. I really should have to worry about colors, and alpha: it should work the same way in both cases.
