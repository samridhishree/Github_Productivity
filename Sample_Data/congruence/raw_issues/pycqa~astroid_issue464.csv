Unfortunately I was unable to find any clues as to why this is happening. I have tried pylint 1.7.4 and pylint 1.6.5. I am using astroid 1.5.3.

Please advise how I can investigate this further.

### Steps to reproduce
Run pylint on sourcecode.

### Current behavior
See attached backtrace.

[error.txt](https://github.com/PyCQA/astroid/files/1440130/error.txt)

### Expected behavior
pylint runs normally.

Thanks for submitting an issue. What would be helpful now would be a reproducing case for this problem, even if it is a blob of code, having a code that we can run against to see where the failure is would be most useful.","",""
