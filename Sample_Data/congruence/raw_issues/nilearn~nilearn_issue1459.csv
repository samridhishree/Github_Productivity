@fliem, do you mind testing this again, as I changed the strategy. It should work fine.","",""

I couldn't think of a way to add a test here.

Great. Once I get @KamalakerDadi's +1, we'll merge.

There is some problem with displaying contours.For instance, a msdl atlas in https://2495-1235740-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/home/ubuntu/nilearn/doc/_build/html/auto_examples/01_plotting/plot_prob_atlas.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-01-plotting-plot-prob-atlas-py

In plot_prob_atlas, we add an heuristic to get the threshold (levels) for displaying. May be we are double thresholding. I might also be wrong. I can have a closer look in more detail, later.","",""
