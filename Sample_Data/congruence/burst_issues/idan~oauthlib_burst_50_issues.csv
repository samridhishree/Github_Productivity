If `credentials['prompt']` is already a list, then calling `split()` triggers an `AttributeError`

This is a deliberately conservative fix that just avoids trying to `split()` twice. It's possible that this bug points to a deeper problem with this approach (are we sure we should be splitting `prompt` when returning the `request_info`?) in the OIDC parameter handling.
