The idea would be to mask the data (NiftiMasker, etc.) to get (X, y), run the sklearn estimator, and then unmask the coefs to get a brain image

This is useful, at least for benchmarks / comparisons, and such situations are quite frequent.

something like that one could easily compare nilearn-native methods which
can deal with niimg objects to wrapped sklearn-estimators using exactly the
same interface. (I just started adding SVM to the mixed gambles example and
there is a lot of boiler plate to write which should be much less with the
type of object you propose)

```
model = WrapSklearnEstimator(estimator_cls, **usual_stuff_for_nilearn_estimators)
model.fit(brain_images, some_labels_etc)
```

 But #698 is probably aiming bigger.
