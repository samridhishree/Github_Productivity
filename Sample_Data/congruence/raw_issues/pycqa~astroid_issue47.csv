This is à long standing bug in PyQt, pylint can't do anything about it
without hardcoding support for it somewhere. The problem is that pyqt crash
upon introspection if QtCore isn't imported first.

Are you refering to http://www.logilab.org/57299?

There it is stated that it is importing QtCore first (before QtGui) that gives the problems.

Anyway, this issue is independent of the order in which PyQt4 components are imported.

It is an issue that arises with the latest pylint and libs.

With an older version;
pylint-script.py 1.2.1,
astroid 1.1.1, common 0.61.0
Python 2.7.8 (default, Jun 30 2014, 16:03:49) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)]

the issue does not occur.

I was indeed refering to this issue. Anyway, this remains a pyqt problem,
the fact that it occurs or not only depends on the level of introspection
done by pylint.

With pylint-script.py 1.2.1, astroid 1.2.X, common 0.62.1 Python 2.7.8 (default, Jun 30 2014, 16:03:49) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] the problem also occurs.

It seems that with astroid 1.2.X this is broken.

Is there any workaround for this?  I can't pylint any of my pyqt code.

I can't reproduce this on Windows, but the problem is somewhat alleviated by using Pylint 1.4 and the corresponding astroid, because since 1.4 we don't try to investigate objects / modules without an underlying source code, as it is the case for PyQt4, thus we don't instantiate them in a improper way. If this is required, pass the flag `--extension-pkg-whitelist=PyQt4` to pylint.
