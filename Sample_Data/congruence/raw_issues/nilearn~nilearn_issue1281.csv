Concrete example: It does not work well for me to apply a 50-region NiftiLabelsMakser on 500 HCP VBM volumes. Could one solution be to internally batch the transformation by chunking image sets and putting the together without the user/coder having to interact with the process or having to introduce a new argument like `batch_size` ?
