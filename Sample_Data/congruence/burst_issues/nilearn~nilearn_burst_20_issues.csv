The reason being that filter_and_mask is a fairly general function that can be used by end users, whereas reference_affine is for internal reasons, and makes no sens outside of the scope in which it is used.

I suggest that a new function, say '_safe_filter_and_mask' should be created, that does the checking and calls filer_and_mask after resetting the 'target_affine'. WDYT?

Well, it pops up in so many places that we need to consider it as public
(and besides, it has no leading underscore). In essence, it is the
function form of the NiftiMasker.

Maybe we should document and advertise it. But let's worry about this
later.

OK. However, do you think that we need an extra option? Can't repr_niimgs
figure this out by itself?

Anyhow, I think that I'd like a different PR for that.
