We also need to check that this is not the case for CanICA","start issue","DictLearning.fit does not work with globs"
"issue_comment","1575","nilearn","nilearn","KamalakerDadi","2017-11-30 16:47:26","I can see fixing this issue by adding a parameter wildcards=True or False (by default) and make use of helper function _resolve_globbing which is in nilearn/_utils/niimg_conversions.py.

_resolve_globbing should be called upon two usecases, one is when imgs are of list pattern [""*.nii.gz""] and str pattern ""*.nii.gz"". In former case, we should loop over the list and append all paths together and give to estimator. If agreed I can go for a FIX.

We do this only in check_niimg but new_img_like has nibabel.load. Moreover, as I said there is difference between resolving globs when given as list. check_niimg will give you single nifti image loaded. Please tell me if I am missing something ?
