is it possible to use plotting.plot_connectome with the coordinates in voxels rather than in mm?
I got the coordinates of the Atlas from fsl/data/atlases/HarvardOxford-Cortical.xml which are not in mm but in voxels.
When I plot the Harvard-Oxford atlas, since plot_connectome expects the coordinates in mm and I get this

So I dont need to change at all the image but transform an array containing the regions from voxel space to cartesian space (in mm). ","",""
