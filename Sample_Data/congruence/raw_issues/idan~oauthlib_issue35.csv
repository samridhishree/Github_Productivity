I'm a member of the Debian Python Module Team and I'm packaging oauthlib for Debian[¹]. The package is
quite ready, you can find it in the team SVN[²]. I only have to enable testing at build time, but right now tests shipped in sdist are not complete: tests/**init**.py and tests/test_common.py are missing.

Please, can you ship them? As a workaround I will put missing files inside the packaging stuff but only you can fix properly this.

Many thanks in advance!

Kind regards,
Daniele Tricoli

many thanks for your fast reply and sorry for my late response.

oauthlib 0.1.2 was uploaded to Debian three days ago[¹]. I'm packaging right now python-rsa and then I will update oauthlib.

Thanks for taking care of shipping tests in sdist.

Cheers,
Daniele Tricoli
