For example, at the moment there's no easy way of finding which, if any, Django packages or Flask packages provide OAuth support using this library.  Linking to [django-oauth-toolkit](https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)  and [flask-oauthlib](https://github.com/lepture/flask-oauthlib), and any other similar packages would be _really_ helpful.
