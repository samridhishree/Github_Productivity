1. This is running a moderate sized Python3 codebase in Pylint and I can't determine what code is exercising this issue.  But the call stack is:
```

3. 

### Current behavior
Exception: `TypeError: 'Uninferable' object does not support indexing`

### Expected behavior
No exception - possibly show an error - not sure.

I can fix the code by changing the code on this line https://github.com/PyCQA/astroid/blob/master/astroid/protocols.py#L512
to:
```
except (IndexError, TypeError):
```

I'm not sure why the error is occurring so have not created a pull request for it.
