I apologize in advance if this not the right forum for asking general questions about nilearn functions, but I couldn’t find a general mailing list.

I have been trying to use the DictLearning class to identify components of a dataset, as performed in Varoquaux et al. 2011. The algorithm described in that paper identifies subject- and group–level spatial maps. However, DictLearning only estimates a single set of components. Taking a closer look at the code, it appears that the decomposition is performed directly by dict_learning_online from sklearn.decomposition. 

`  self.components_, _ = self._cache(dict_learning_online)(
            data.T, self.n_components, alpha=self.alpha, n_iter=n_iter,
            batch_size=self.batch_size, method=self.method,
            dict_init=dict_init, verbose=max(0, self.verbose - 1),
            random_state=self.random_state, return_code=True, shuffle=True,
            n_jobs=1)`

As far as I can tell from the documentation, dict_learning_online does not implement the “two-level” decomposition described in Varoquaux et al 2011, but rather a mini-batch version of (single-level) dictionary learning.

So am I misunderstanding something or is DictLearning not implementing the algorithm described in Varoquaux et al 2011? Could someone perhaps clarify this for me?
