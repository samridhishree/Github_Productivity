"issue_title","1549","nilearn","nilearn","GaelVaroquaux","2017-11-13 13:16:00","We should add a mask_strategy=""template"" to NiftiMasker that computes the mask by resampling the MNI gray matter tissue to the images, and thresholds it.

The logic behind this (as opposed to the mask_strategy=""epi"") would be to remove the dependence of the mask on the data at hand (eg in a cross-validation loop) and thus make the computation more cache friendly.

We would have to create a function ""compute_grey_matter_mask"" in masking.py which take the ""target_img"" and an optional ""threshold"" argument as an input and returns the mask.","start issue","MNI canonical mask in NiftiMasker"
