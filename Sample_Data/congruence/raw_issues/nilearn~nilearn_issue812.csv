"issue_title","812","nilearn","nilearn","AlexandreAbraham","2015-11-02 14:17:32","Some users complained about the fact that it is not possible to chose the location for the cut in plotting functions. It turns out that they did not know about `cut_coords`.

Also, for them, the `display_mode` is not clear. For example, they don't understand why they have to pass only 2 coordinates when using 'xz'.

"issue_comment","812","nilearn","nilearn","lesteve","2015-11-03 07:53:51","I thought what @AlexandreAbraham had in mind was to allow to pass cut_coords as list of 3d coordinates irrespective of the display_mode. This way you can change the display_mode without having to worry about changing cut_coords.

I mean, if I use cut_coords=40, I wouldn't like to plot 40 slices in a row, but maybe a grid of 5x8 slices.
I was thinking that an argument, e.g., `plot_grid=(5, 8)`, would help, if there is no other way to do this.
I have been trying to implement something like this for a while, if you indicate me what should be changed, I could do it.

P.S.: I know that I have another open issue, but this is more urgent for me, I will arrive to the other one one day.
