"issue_title","1175","nilearn","nilearn","banilo","2016-07-09 12:17:45","It appears tricky to download the full ABIDE datasets as it stands today. There may be 3 different problems:
1) the download freezed several times with different Wifi connections
2) already downloaded parts of previously failed fetch attemps are not resumed
3) Operation timed out error occurs every once in a while
