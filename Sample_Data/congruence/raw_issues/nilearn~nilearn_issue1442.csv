`haxby_dataset = datasets.fetch_haxby()`

It says it's grabbing data from https://www.nitrc.org/frs/download.php/7868/mask.nii.gz but the website appears to be down. 

The full error I get is:
`URLError: <urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:749)| Error while fetching file mask.nii.gz; dataset fetching aborted.>`

Any thoughts on what is going on, or when the website will be back up?","start issue","NITRC is down"

""NITRC suffered hardware failure last week and we are working to restore the site.
  Until then NITRC has limited functionality, including missing files for download.  We hope to have this fixed by the end of the week.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
