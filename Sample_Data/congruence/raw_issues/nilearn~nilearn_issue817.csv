```
import nibabel
import numpy as np
from nilearn.image import resample_img
affine = np.eye(4)
img = nibabel.Nifti1Image(np.zeros((2, 2, 2)).astype(np.int16), affine)
resample_img(img, target_affine=2. * affine)
```

I think similar data types are also concerned

Possible fix: The data should be cast before passing to `ndimage.interpolate`, etc.
