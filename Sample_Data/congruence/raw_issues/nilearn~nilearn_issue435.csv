This seems like a great dataset for using machine learning to discover structure.  In fact, they ran a contest for best results so far, and the winner implements some algorithms that may be of interest.

That way, you don't have to maintain the code, but people like me can browse other examples (for example: if someone preprocessed datasets using nipype, then did machine learning in nilearn) and other code (like a generic openfrmi fetcher, if @schwarty has one or if I create one).

That would still take some maintenance, but I believe much less on your team, and potentially add a lot of value to users.

@schwarty I plan to look at this later in the week; if you have any code for getting started on an OpenFMRI fetcher (or design considerations you think I should keep in mind), please let me know!
