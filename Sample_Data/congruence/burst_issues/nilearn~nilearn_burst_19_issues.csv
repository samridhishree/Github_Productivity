It would reduce loading time, and leverage caching. Mobile devices usually have a policy of caching only very small files (http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/06/28/mobile-browser-cache-limits/). Even jQuery itself is probably too big.

@jaquesgrobler can you add the minified versions of jquery.js, doctools.js, etc.? (and use them in html, instead of the current versions). You may want to keep readable files as well (but not use them in html), that would help future debugging/understanding.

The second loads data for several subjects and compute a CV'd group-sparse covariance. There are in practice only one thing that differs between them: the optimization algorithm.

A bit of both. However, feature is very standard, very tasks is less. It
might be useful to put in some places signals in parenthesis, just to

OK, but in the non CV estimator, isn't it used? I would expect that the
dual gap would be a good stopping criterion in this situation. I think
that we had a conversation on that. No use reminding me what the
conclusion were, just go ahead with what you think is right and drop it
if you feel that there is no use for it.

A test is failing on Travis (np.diff(objective) <= 0 in
test_group_sparse_covariance.py:51), that does not occur of the
developer's machine. np.diff(objective) may be hitting the numerical
noise floor (1e-14 or so). Some values may then be slightly positive.
This is most probably due to a different numerical library which leads to
a slightly different result.

The fix consists in decreasing the number of iterations so that optimization
stops before hitting the noise floor.",8647d78eff16492804d460e5666e91c9a8fb9ea5,
