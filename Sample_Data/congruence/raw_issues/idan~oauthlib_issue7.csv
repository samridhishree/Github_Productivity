"issue_title","7","idan","oauthlib","ib-lundgren","2012-03-15 20:21:01","Curious to why they are named OAuth1a when OAuth 1a is obsoleted by the OAuth RFC 5849? (http://oauth.net/core/1.0a/)

I suggest renaming them to OAuthClient and OAuthServer and have the module define the version:

```
# OAuth 1
from oauthlib.oauth import OAuthClient

# Possible future OAuth 2 scenario...
from oauthlib.oauth2 import OAuthConfidentialClient , OAuthPublicClient
```

What do you think?

Also, does questions like this one go under ""Issues"" or somewhere else?

I think the correct answer is to namespace everything currently under oauthlib/ to oauthlib/oauth1_RFC5849/ but keeping the class names OAuthServer and OAuthClient.  Then when we implement oauth2 it can be namespaced under oauthlib/oauth2_draft18/ or whatever.

@idangazit didn't want to change it right now, so I'll follow his lead on when is the best time to restructure.

"issue_comment","7","idan","oauthlib","ib-lundgren","2012-03-15 21:42:06","Sounds good. Really like the structure of the OAuthLib now and think its advancing awesomely.

Noted another thing...

Currently resource owner key and resource owner secret is set to mandatory arguments to OAuthClient which might not be what we want. When obtaining a request/temporary token the client will usually have neither, the resource owner secret is most often obtained together with the ""access token"" in the last step of the authentication. 

The oauth_token parameter may be set to an empty string so maybe that would be a good default value? Or None and not include it in params at all if not set. (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-2.1)

The resource owner secret could safely be set to None without affecting the HMAC-SHA signature.

"issue_comment","7","idan","oauthlib","dgouldin","2012-03-15 21:55:56","Changes required to the library should in theory be very straightforward.  Simply point out where we're not adhering to the spec, and if you're correct, it's a bug, without exception.  In the case where a paramater has a default if not specified or is not required, it should be represented as a keyword argument in the method used to fulfill that part of the spec, again without exception.

If you'd like to send a pull request for this particular change, I'd be happy to look it over and give you pointers if it's not pythonic, but I think you have the right idea.  To satisfy the pedant in me, please open as a separate issue if you want to send a pull request.
