Title's a bit of a mouthful but explains it all, in the following snippet:
```python
class A:
    @b(lambda self: self.c)
    def d(self):
        pass
```
The `self` inside the `lambda` is inferred as an instance of `d` (the method) rather than `A` (the class).

Now this is problematic because PyLint's Python3 checker [wonders if an attribute is an instance of StandardException](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/master/pylint/checkers/python3.py#L770), and does so by [looking at the node's ancestors](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/master/pylint/checkers/utils.py#L456), assuming the node is a proper instance that should yield the base classes of the parent class.

Except here the ""parent class"" is a FunctionDef which does not have an `ancestors` attribut, and PyLint thus crashes:

### Expected behavior
Not crashing pylint.

### ``python -c ""from astroid import __pkginfo__; print(__pkginfo__.version)""`` output
