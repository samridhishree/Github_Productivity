I don't think that's super critical but @AlexandreAbraham you may have a suggestion off the top of your head? I looked at it a bit but I couldn't figure out what was happening. From what I understood, the file was downloaded and unzipped fine but then the target file was not where it was supposed to be somehow.

The full traceback:

Concerning the initial Localizer 94 data, the only _mask_ file I am able to find is `mask.nii.gz`.

Concerning the code that generates the ZIP file on the Brainomics server, I recall [version 0.4.5 of module _brainomics_](http://hg.logilab.org/review/cubes/brainomics/rev/1943ec3fcebc) is being used. Specifically have a look at `views/download.py`. Unfortunately bowsing the source code on the above server is currently broken and I don't have the time to fetch the code and have a look at it on my machine.

I don' t have access to the server either. I would have to sit down with one of the sysadmins and examine the issue. It would take to much time to organize.

I suggest you stick to `boolean_mask_mask.nii.gz` - the current behavior. It shouldn't change because the server is fozen. If it ever does, please come back to me and I will investigate.
