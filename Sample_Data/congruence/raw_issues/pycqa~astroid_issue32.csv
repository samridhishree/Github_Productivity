Hi,

I am in the process of updating pylint and dependencies in OpenBSD ports. I have ancountered a problem with astroid's install target.

In short, OpenBSD ports runs the build as a normal user, the install as root, and then removes the sources as the normal user. We package a ton of Python modules in this way.

The problem with astroid is, when `setup.py install` is run as root, it puts files owned by root in the build directory which then cannot be removed by the normal user. The install target should only copy files into the python library dirs and not modify the build directory.

You can reproduce this outside OpenBSD ports by making a virtualenv and running `setup.py install` as a root and then try to remove the source dir:

```
wilfred:tmp> rm -Rf astroid-1.1.1                                                                                                                                      
rm: astroid-1.1.1/build/lib/astroid/test/data2/clientmodule_test.py: Permission denied
rm: astroid-1.1.1/build/lib/astroid/test/data2/suppliermodule_test.py: Permission denied
rm: astroid-1.1.1/build/lib/astroid/test/data2/__init__.py: Permission denied
rm: astroid-1.1.1/build/lib/astroid/test/data2: Directory not empty
rm: astroid-1.1.1/build/lib/astroid/test/data/noendingnewline.py: Permission denied
rm: astroid-1.1.1/build/lib/astroid/test/data/absimport.py: Permission denied
rm: astroid-1.1.1/build/lib/astroid/test/data/SSL1/__init__.py: Permission denied
rm: astroid-1.1.1/build/lib/astroid/test/data/SSL1/Connection1.py: Permission denied
rm: astroid-1.1.1/build/lib/astroid/test/data/SSL1: Permission denied
...
```

Would appreciate a patch so I can continue updating pylint.

Cheers

This is due to custom things done in setup.py, I agree it should be fixed but that's not trivial, hence one have to find some time to find an alternative and implement it.

Is there a workaround I can use in the meantime?

chmod/chown the build dir ? I fail to see a workaround on the python side :(

The build script has been cleaned up, this should not be an issue any more.
