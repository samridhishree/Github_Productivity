display.add_contours(csf_mask_img, colors='c')

May be we can catch this error and simply replace it by a warning ? For instance, I use ROIs contours on top of my stat map plot but I don't want it to break just because of this visualization issue. What do you think ?","start issue","could display.add_contours error when no contour found be replaced with warning ?"

You should see something like this if it could able to find mask (contour) to overlay.

nilearn/plotting/displays.py:670: UserWarning: empty mask
