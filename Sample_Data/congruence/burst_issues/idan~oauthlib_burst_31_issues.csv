I suppose it's a question for @ib-lundgren @idan whether to depend on `blinker` like this. As a user of requests, I'd be fine with this solution since it doesn't _require_ me to have `blinker` installed, but gives me an optional way to handle this case (scope change) if I want to.

I think blinker can be pretty neat for monitoring / debugging / testing and
don't mind it too much since we can default to not installing it (falling
back on the no-op) and users who want it can install extra packages.

I'm not sure I see how it would fit into a normal client work flow without
being awkward. I think making the token a dict subclass with a
scope_changed boolean property might be neater.

```
client = BackendApplicationClient(...)
token = client.fetch_token(...)
if token.scope_changed:
     # uh oh we need to disable some features
     for scope in token.scopes:
           enable_feature_for_scope(scope)
     for scope in token.unauthorized_scopes:
           disable_feature_for_scope(scope)
```

The benefit of callbacks would be not having to check for scoped_changed
but not sure how big a win that is. Maybe I'm missing something...
