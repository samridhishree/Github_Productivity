We would need a tiny example demoing it.

Maybe you can do a new example in the plotting section that demos plot connectome and replace the image in https://circle-artifacts.com/gh/nilearn/nilearn/1495/artifacts/0/home/ubuntu/nilearn/doc/_build/html/plotting/index.html#different-plotting-functions by the image it generates (and link to that example).

I think that, for now, we could use a hard-coded set of coordinates and connectivity matrix, for instance inspired by: https://circle-artifacts.com/gh/nilearn/nilearn/1495/artifacts/0/home/ubuntu/nilearn/doc/_build/html/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_adhd_spheres.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-03-connectivity-plot-adhd-spheres-py

Actually, that's probably a good idea. And that way we have edges going
to it in both plot (this needs to be documented in the docstrings of
add_marker and plot_connectome).
