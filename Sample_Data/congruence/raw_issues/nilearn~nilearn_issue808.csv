Added an appveyor.yml file to configure the automatic setup of the environnement installation, nilearn dist installation and testing.

Note the environnement is set up using miniconda because I couldn't build some nilearn dependencies (scipy/scikit-learn). I tried to use python-appveyor-demo project but couldn't make it work : scipy needs lapack/blas libraries.

I don't think anyone actually pays close attention to it to be honest.

In my experience, problems on master are more likely to be discovered by someone running the tests locally rather than someone looking at the github page README.rst.

Installing matplotlib with pip seems fine since there are wheels available for Windows on PyPI. I seem to remember installing it with conda pulls in a lot of dependencies, including qt.

The target of the image seems overly complicated, is there a good reason for it? The scikit-learn one is:
https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/scikit-learn/scikit-learn?branch=master&svg=true

so I guess we can use something similar.

I missed that, yes please install it with conda this is more in line with nilearn installation instructions.

The general guideline is to install everything with conda if it is available and the rest with pip.

If there is no good reason to specify an explicit numpy version I would remove it, i.e. just use numpy rather than numpy==whatever.
