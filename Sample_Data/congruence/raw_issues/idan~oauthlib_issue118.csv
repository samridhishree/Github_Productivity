We should provide a guidance document to help prospective OAuth providers choose what they should support to best cater to their target clients. 

For example,
- Unable to use SSL? Use OAuth 1
- Require Holder of Key (link) right now? Use OAuth 1
- Your target client is a
  - javascript or mobile application? Use OAuth 2 Implicit Grant (MobileApplicationServer)
  - web app (i.e. lives on the web server)? Use OAuth 2 Authorization Code Grant (WebApplicationServer)
  - web application moving away from directly using the users username and password to using OAuth 2 tokens but unable to switch to only use tokens because of legacy dependencies? Use OAuth 2 Resource Owner Password Credentials grant (LegacyApplicationServer)
  - trusted backend job working on user data but not interacting with a user? Use OAuth 2 Client Credentials grant (BackendApplicationServer)
- Need to support dynamic client registration? Use OAuth 2 (more on this in #109)

the recent facebook hickup.
