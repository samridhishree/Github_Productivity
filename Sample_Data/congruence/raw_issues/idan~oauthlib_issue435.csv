"issue_title","435","idan","oauthlib","eastein","2016-09-14 03:07:11","The OAuth2.0 RFC requires the authorization server to support using Basic auth to pass the client authentication to the identity provider, but the Request class doesn't appear to support this.

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3.1

In particular, this part of the spec seems relevant:

""The authorization server MUST support the HTTP Basic
   authentication scheme for authenticating clients that were issued a
   client password.""

Am I missing something and this actually can be made to work? I reviewed the source (https://github.com/idan/oauthlib/blob/master/oauthlib/common.py#L358) and it does not appear to do anything that would make Basic auth work.

If this was left out in purpose, is there a recommended way to add in support without having to patch oauthlib?
