OK, but then please use 'nisl.signal.clean'. 'import as' is strongly
frowned upon in general because it creates a vocabulary that is
coder-specific.

Technically, if you can store int8 in Niftis, you don't need a memory
copy:

```
In [4]: a = np.ones(10, dtype=np.int8)

In [6]: b = a.view(np.bool)

In [7]: b.shape
Out[7]: (10,)

In [8]: np.may_share_memory(a, b)
Out[8]: True

There is a solution: use an int8 instead in Nifti1Image. Provided as_ndarray is used everywhere to convert to np.bool, there is almost no additional cost (np.bool and np.int8 are close to being the same thing for numpy).

In terms of API, I still am not a huge fan of the duo: apply_mask_to_regions and apply_regions. I think that I would prefer an option 'mask' to apply_regions', that, if not None, would apply the mask.

I think that we need to detrend the signals :). This is not terribly important here, because of the high_pass filter, but still, I think that this is a good habit to give to people.

This is looking good! The next step is to have a 'transformer' that does all this!

I understand your point of view on regions masking, and that keeping the labels after masking could be useful. However, integrating this in apply_mask_to_regions() would lead to an inconsistent API imo. The output of apply_mask_to_regions() is designed to be used as input to apply_regions(), nothing else in the present state.

I used the word ""unapply"" to get a consistent pair of function names (apply_mask / unmask being not consistent enough for me).

Still, I agree on the fact that the name is confusing. I made a proposal at the very beginning of this thread that nobody commented on: adding an option to apply_mask() to distinguish between the regions and fMRI data cases. That would be a way to get rid of apply_mask_to_regions().

As for the detrending, it was already done (line 81), but independently of nisl.signals.clean(). The reason why I did it that way is that high_variance_confounds() must operate on detrended signals, and clean() too. The best way was to detrend the signals once, and not repeat the detrending in clean(). However, mvt_confounds could have a trend in them as well, and in the current state, they're not detrended. I added a call to _detrend() to clean to fix that. This is however rather convoluted for a low-level programmer, so I'll think of something clearer in the very near future.

This file uses only functions and no transformers on purpose: the goal is to show the low-level API to advanced users.

- Vocabulary: ""maps"" and ""labels"" designate respectively fuzzy regions (possibly intersecting), and flat regions (non intersecting). The former being defined using weights in several 3D arrays, the latter using labels in a single 3D array. This vocabulary is consistent with Scipy's (see e.g. scipy.ndimage.measurements.label or .find_objects). ""images"", abbreviated ""img"" are 3D arrays, with a mandatory affine (even a trivial one). ""signals"" is a series of values extracted from a single voxel. The word ""timeseries"" is somehow specific to resting-state acquisitions: a signal is not necessarily evenly sampled, which is suggested by the term ""timeseries"".
- Separate functions must exist for maps and labels processing. This will make cleaner API and permit some optimizations by using shortcuts in some cases.
- Every 3D or 4D array must come with an affine, to permit automatic resampling. This implies passing niimgs as input in every such case, and not just numpy arrays.

I suggest to create the following functions (that would replace the existing un|apply_regions): 
- signals_from_labels() and signals_from_maps(): for extracting signals from regions defined by labels and maps respectively. Both functions take niimgs as inputs, and return a 2D numpy array, containing signals as columns.
- img_from_labels() and img_from_maps(): for inverting signals_from_*() functions. Both take a 2D array as input, and ouput a NiftiImage.

and make the modifications:
- high_variance_confounds() should take images as input, not signals.
- rename ""regions_are_overlapping"" to ""maps_are_overlapping""
- remove all the conversion functions (_regions___to__), possibly with the exception of those involving labels, because they might prove useful, especially _regions_array_to_labels().

Getting a precise yet general definition is kind of tricky in the present case.

- created NiftiLabelsMasker, which basically does the same thing as NiftiMasker, but with regions defined as labels instead of just an single mask. Most features are implemented, with the notable exception of joblib and resampling (see below).
- an example have been created to show the use of the new NiftiLabelsMasker: plot_regions_covariance_obj.py. This script is very close to plot_regions_covariance.py, which only uses functions, and no object. One of them is probably to remove, feel free to comment on this point.

In docstrings, we usually say ""array-like"", rather than ""numpy.ndarray"", as other objects should work.

The return section is not correctly formatted. It won't build the docs right.

The remark on ordering faster is true only for numpy belove 1.7. Anyhow, I would try doing something like:

var = np.copy(series)
var **= 2
var = var.sum(axis=0)

I believe that this should always be fast (not tested, please correct me if I am wrong).

- The solution you give is slightly slower (of the order of 10%) than the best solution I found, though way better than the worst one. This is true for both numpy 1.3 and numpy 1.7. Ratio of execution time (best solution/your solution) are similar across versions. Here are the times I find on my mini-benchmark (the second times is your solution):

**C order** numpy 1.7: 1.0s vs 1.2s. numpy 1.3: 1.3s vs 1.6s.

For @GaelVaroquaux: I used your solution in the code. I replaced var.sum() by var.mean() because there is no significant change in execution time, and if people are copy-pasting, they'll end up with a proper computation for variance, not for sum of squares.

There are two solution for this problem:
- NiftiMultiMasker.fit() could resample the data. This would be computationnaly expensive but there is a high probability that these data will be passed to transform after that.
- compute_multi_epi_mask could compute the mean epis, then resample them (which is not costly) and then compute the group mask.

I think the second solution is the best even if it implies adding options to compute_multi_epi_mask.

What do you think ?

Sounds good to me.
