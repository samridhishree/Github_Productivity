This is a simple pull request to add optional title and annotation kwarg dictionaries to `_plt_img_with_bg`.  This is intended to make it easier for users to edit the title and/or annotation font size, color, etc. via functions such as `plot_roi` or `plot_img`

example usage:

``` python
plotting.plot_roi(roi_nii,
                  title='roi label',
                  annotation_kwargs=dict(size=10),
                  title_kwargs=dict(size=12, color='k', bgcolor='w',
                                    weight='bold', alpha=0.))
```

If there is already another simple way to do this, please let me know.  If you are interested in this implementation, I can explicitly list these arguments in the docstrings to `plot_roi`, etc so that they are easier for users to find, instead of leaving them ""hidden"" within **kwargs as presently implemented.

Also, one minor inconsistency is that the background color argument for the title is `bgcolor`, while for the annotation it would be `bg_color`.  Is it worth changing the implementation in `plotting.displays.BaseSlicer` to make the names consistent?

One way to do what you want with the existing code is something like:

``` python

display = plotting.plot_roi(roi_nii, annotate=False)
display.title('roi_label', size=12, color='k', bgcolor='w', weight='bold', alpha=0.)
display.annotate(size=12)
```

My take on it is that we are trying to fight against adding more complexity in the plotting code but ccing @GaelVaroquaux and @AlexandreAbraham for their opinions on the matter.

The rationale is that plotting.plot_\* functions should cover the most basic use cases. If you need more tweaking it can be done via the 'display' objects that these functions return.

That looks just as easy.  I should have looked more closely to see that the object was returned and you could just set it then as in matplotlib!  

Perhaps, something along these lines could be added to one of the examples here:
