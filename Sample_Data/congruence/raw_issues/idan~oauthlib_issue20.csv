Here is a brief overview of what I've changed:
- Fix a collection of broken variables and constants
- Fixed a bug where the server was getting the signature from params when it should've been getting the signature method.
- Removed the invalid 'safe' parameter from `urllib.unquote()`
- Fix a broken condition in `signature.collect_parameters()` which was comparing against the value instead of the key.
- Fix a bug where the Server wasn't passing through the http_method to the client when generating the signature.
- Changed `parameters.prepare_headers()` so that it doesn't use unicode strings after they've been passed through `utils.escape()`
- Fixed a bug where the client was dropping all the headers except the `Authorization` header when signing a request.
- Added support for only including the body in the signature's base string when the Content-Type is set to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. This brings it inline with the RFC and stops multipart requests failing.
- Fixed a bug where HMAC SHA1 signatures were breaking when either secret was `None`

Looks good.

```
Changed parameters.prepare_headers() so that it doesn't use unicode strings after they've been passed through utils.escape()
```

OAuthLib is unicode everwhere, in unicode, out unicode. The spec mentions character codes in ASCII but if you convert unicode to ascii you will see that they are not violated. ie 34 == ord(u'""'.encode(""ascii""))

```
Added support for only including the body in the signature's base string when the Content-Type is set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded. This brings it inline with the RFC and stops multipart requests failing.
```

It is true that when contributing parameters from the request body there is only one allowed content type, application/x-www-form-urlencoded (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.4.1.3.1), which must be present in the content-type request header. It is safe to assume this will be the default value, please update content_type to be an optional argument of collect_parameters with default value u'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'. 

```
Removed the invalid 'safe' parameter from urllib.unquote()
```

~ really is a safe character http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.6 #2

Fixed a bug where the client was dropping all the headers except the Authorization header when signing a request.

Can't seem to find which change you refer to.

Ah, I probably should've clarified that before I made the change. Part of the problem was that `utils.unescape()` was only accepting non-unicode strings, and `signature.collect_parameters()` would only unescape strings that weren't unicode. Which means a header passed to it as a unicode string wouldn't be handled correctly.

If you're happy, I can revert that changeset and remove the restrictions on `utils.unescape()` to allow both unicode and str types and fix `signature.collect_paramters()` so that it will call `unescape()` for both types of string.

Yep I can make that change. If I do that should I also add content_type as an argument to the methods that call `collect_parameters()` so the code underneath can pass that through?

At the moment it is extracting it from the request headers and will default to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` if it isn't set.

> > Removed the invalid 'safe' parameter from urllib.unquote()

Yep, I didn't remove it because it wasn't 'safe', but because [urllib.unquote](http://docs.python.org/library/urllib.html#urllib.unquote) doesn't have 'safe' as an argument. Also `urllib.unquote('~') == '~'` which means it works correctly.

I'm refering to changeset [f744f6ca1f81e6d48044f7416472f39dbd6e573c](https://github.com/calebbrown/oauthlib/commit/f744f6ca1f81e6d48044f7416472f39dbd6e573c)

Yes, that's better. What do you think @dgouldin @idangazit?

Good idea but might be worth its own pull request.

Fair enough =) Interestingly the Python docs only mention '_.-' to be safe by default http://docs.python.org/library/urllib.html#urllib.quote. Might be a good idea to add a comment mentioning this.

Ah alright, looks good.
