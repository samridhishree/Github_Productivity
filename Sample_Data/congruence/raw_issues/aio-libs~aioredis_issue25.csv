``` python
other_redis = yield from create_redis('localhost', self.redis_port, loop=self.loop)
```

results in:

``` python
  File ""tests/_testutil.py"", line 18, in wrapper
    ret = loop.run_until_complete(fun(test, *args, **kw))
  File ""/usr/lib/python3.4/asyncio/base_events.py"", line 208, in run_until_complete
    return future.result()
  File ""/usr/lib/python3.4/asyncio/futures.py"", line 243, in result
    raise self._exception
  File ""/usr/lib/python3.4/asyncio/tasks.py"", line 321, in _step
    result = next(coro)
  File ""tests/list_commands_test.py"", line 30, in test_blpop
    other = yield from create_redis('localhost', self.redis_port, loop=self.loop)
  File ""/home/nick/sources/python/aioredis/aioredis/commands/__init__.py"", line 90, in create_redis
    conn = yield from create_connection(address, db, password, loop=loop)

    lambda: protocol, path, **kwds)
  File ""/usr/lib/python3.4/asyncio/unix_events.py"", line 188, in create_unix_connection
    yield from self.sock_connect(sock, path)
  File ""/usr/lib/python3.4/asyncio/futures.py"", line 350, in __iter__
    return self.result()  # May raise too.
  File ""/usr/lib/python3.4/asyncio/futures.py"", line 243, in result
    raise self._exception
  File ""/usr/lib/python3.4/asyncio/selector_events.py"", line 295, in _sock_connect
    sock.connect(address)
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

So I added new connection creation to `setUp()` and everithing works just fine.
Is this something with my `redis`?
