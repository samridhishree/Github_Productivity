The easiest way forward is probably to do manually what six does. It's actually suprisingly easy. Joblib does it this way:
- [x] replace all the 'xrange' by 'range'
- [x] the urlib, StringIO and cPickle moves can be tackled by try/except imports
- [x] the string_types is the hardest. I suspect that it can be handled by something like https://github.com/joblib/joblib/blob/master/joblib/_compat.py

Because we don't want to be tied to nibabel. If one day we change the image format nilearn relies on, all we will have to do is to change the dependency on that file.

@GaelVaroquaux I totally understand your apprehension about thin wrappers since they definitely add a layer, however thin it is. As somebody who has difficulties getting into new codebases and their practices, this type of thing would definitely be an added one for me.

But really, `new_img` seems very elegant to me, at least much more elegant than `nibabel.Nifti1Image` -- which to new users may actually be equally shocking simply by its unwieldiness.

`nibabel.Nifti1Image` still works for anybody who wants to use it, and one can always see `new_img` as a simple alias, so I really think this change is worth it.

Wrt `new_img_like`, maybe tackling it right now is a good idea. Do we need a discussion about the `mode=` that had been put forward? (I am not sure which ones there would be.)

Because it is impossible to have booleans in nifti, right? Elsewhere it
would indeed be different.

That just reminded me what is the ""right"" way to do it in the nilearn
codebase: _utils.numpy_conversions._asarray(arr, dtype=np.bool). This
code does some tricks to avoid a memory copy when converting from int8 to
bool. Philippe wrote that because he was annoyed that we couldn't store
booleans in nifti files.

I think that the goal is to prevent memory leaks: when 'get_data' is
called, the niftiimage object has the data attached to it. If a reference
is kept on this object, outside of the function, we have a memory leak,
as the function just loaded data that won't be removed.

Hint: one is almost like the other.

Given that paths are passed to `mean_img`, the caching system should not change anything between the versions. Both should be able to do the mean given the memory limit as they only need to load images one by one.

The result is that they both endup in memory error after 8 images. There must be a leak somewhere but I can't find out where. I'll keep the code as-is but we should maybe investigate that and add some tests.

Well, the problem is that not resetting some values will give you bugs
that are very hard to debug with the softwares that respect these values.

I suggest that you put 'cal_min', 'cal_max' to zero (which means None in
Nifti terms), or better, to the min and max.

In general, I might even do the following:
{'scl_slope':0, 'scl_inter':0, 'glmax':0, 'glmin':0, 'cal_max':0,
'cal_min':0}

Once again: these things are really tricky, and if you don't do it right,
you'll end up with bugs. I am actually very weary of the nifti header.

`ref_img.__class__(data, affine, header=header)`. This is why I chose a polymorphic constructor to solve this problem.

Several options:
- The polymorphic constructor
- Have a custom type that does not allow modifications
- Use a clever code to fallback to Nifti1Image if a constructor fails in `new_img_like`
- Make the template derive from Nifti1Image and make clever code to find a suitable constructor in super classes in `new_img_like`

Although I haven't understood the design choice until now, it has never been a problem to use it that way.

Let's compare! First version is the current implementation, second is the proposed one.

If I have a recarray with x, y and z fields:
`plot_connectome(adj, recarray[['x', 'y', 'z']])`
`plot_connectome(adj, recarray['x'], recarray['y'], recarray['z'])`

If I have 3 numpy arrays (or lists):
`plot_connectome(adj, zip(x, y, z))`
`plot_connectome(adj, x, y, z)`

If I have a list of triblets:
`plot_connectome(adj, coords)`
`plot_connectome(adj, *zip(*coords))`

Given that there is no performance issue either way, I would be in favor of the triblet representation.

Well. I would write 'np.vstack(x, y, z).T' given that the good practice

That one is horrible and should never be written in an example, but you
would write:

```
x, y, z = coords.T
plot_connectome(adj, *zip(*coords))
```

By the way, an example of where it's troubling me is:
https://github.com/GaelVaroquaux/nilearn/blob/doc_rework/examples/connectivity/plot_probabilistic_atlas_extraction.py

The atlas here helpfully provides a list of coordinates, that gets loaded

Oh, OK, you really use a recarray. I quit using them to use panda dataframes because of jokes like this. Note that a lot of stuff may break in nilearn if you use recarrays. I have started a branch where I fix some of these but it's a lot of work.

> Well. I would write 'np.vstack(x, y, z).T' given that the good practice is usually to teach people numpy

I think that good practices don't include recarrays. In particular, getting back to regular arrays is very very ugly (I would advise to pass by a list instead): `a.view(np.float).reshape(len(a), -1)`

> That one is horrible and should never be written in an example

Agreed, but I showed one-liners only. This would work too but it contains ""magic"": `plot_connectome(adj, *coords.T)`

```
import pandas
labels = pandas.read_csv(csv_filename)
# ...
plotting.plot_connectome(correlation_matrix, coords[['x', 'y', 'z']], edge_threshold=""80%"")

Problem solved ;)

Actually, I would be more in favor of accepting object that has fields 'x', 'y', and 'z' rather than 3 separate arrays. But again, personal opinion from a pandas user.

OK. Then let's use panda dataframes in our examples. You were against it
a while ago. I think that this is a good option.

I have no specific love for recarrays. It's just that so far, we didn't
use pandas in the examples. I am +1 for pandas.

Yes, I thought that it was a bit ""overkill"". But the only alternative is np.recarray and the `shape` problem is not the only one with them... So let's use pandas.

It would also handle dicts, bunchs... But this was just a suggestion.

the output of transform must be 2D to obey scikit-learn's convention.
Thus a 3D (n_x, n_y, n_z) image and a 4D (n_x, n_y, n_z, 1) image are
cast to the same 'X' matrix. For one of these two, 
inverse_transform(transform()) will fail to give the same shape as the
original.

We are open to changing the current convention, ie to always cast to 4D,
if you give us good arguments.

1,issue_title,455,nilearn,nilearn,vsoch,2015-02-22 21:48:47,"The current ""plot glass brain"" chooses a color map that is aesthetically beautiful, but is misleading with regard to properly communicating the values in the map.  For example, an image with clear negative values:

![actual](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/814322/6320586/f20c3d8c-ba96-11e4-8502-9fe2f72a62dd.png)

I understand that the image is mimicking the standard of the spm glass brain, but as a user, I don't really remember that.  (Is the traditional spm glass brain a maximum intensity projection?)  Regardless, the default users of the package (myself included) will make some strong assumptions about the colors that come out:
- red/orange is positive
- blue is negative

So I would conclude from the glass brain image that my brain map has many strongly positive values.

I found that I have the [choice to specify the color map](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/nilearn/plotting/img_plotting.py#L724), so what I did is an [investigation of all the color maps that could be used](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/vsoch/brainmeta/blob/master/image_comparison/notebook/glass_brain_colormaps.ipynb).  There are many that (at least) have the right colors, red and blue, but the mappings are still off.  And most of the other ones aren't as striking as the hot oranges and yellows. So I want to suggest that we possibly need a ""functional neuroimaging"" specific color map. It might be a slightly modified glass brain with a [custom color map](http://matplotlib.org/api/colors_api.html) that is both breathtaking, and scales from blue to bright orange, correctly depicting the positive and negative values without need for an ugly colorbar. Then we can oooh and aaah at the images, and also not interpret them incorrectly. :wink:

I am also wondering whether the one can infer anything from e.g. all values being positive vs there existing negative and positive values together. We automatically adjust the range of the colormap in `plot_stat_map` for this and show only the appropriate half of a double colormap if necessary. Applying this to here would mean that the default colormap should become ColdHot and that only the upper half is used when all values are positive.

The glass brain projection uses the max of the **absolute value** along the axis, so you are left with only positive values. The only place this is documented is in plotting.displays.GlassBrainAxes.transform_to_2d.

It's probably easy to add the sign back if we decide this is the right way forward (looking at the argmax of the absolute value and returning the value of the original array for example). To be honest, not sure what the convention is for the SPM glass brain.

In the long run, I think we are moving toward interactive graphics [eg, bokeh has little bits](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/index.html), but most graphics on their own without some added stuffs from a web browser are still static. Ideally, any image produced would be svg, possibly with multiple transparent layers that could be quickly wrapped in some d3/etc. to spit out something interactive for the user.  That also means that we need paths and not image data embedded in the svg.  An animation is another option, but I think we can do better. I'm just thinking out loud at this point - the goal (I think) is to bring modern, simple interactive visualizations to brain imaging tools.

Adding the sign back according to the sign of the argmax of the absolute values is maybe a little ""unfair"" if most activation values along that axis are positive and there was one small negative blob. Same for vice versa. Shouldn't then taking the absolute value be re-examined?

For positive maps you wouldn't need it. For mixed maps it is weird. 

What about linear projections onto the mean value along each axis? (I am assuming it has been tried and didn't look good, because it is the obvious first choice.)

1,issue_title,362,nilearn,nilearn,bcipolli,2015-01-22 05:49:48,"Right now, each time a Memory object is created, a path must be given to a cache location.  The safest path to specify is one relative to the script location.  This is inconvenient:
- Cache files are distributed in multiple locations and therefore hard to clear.
- Searching the source tree becomes slow (as some search programs search all files for text)
- If the cache location isn't already in the `.gitignore`, then git workflow can become messy (for example, using `git gui`).

I would like cache location to work like nilearn download/data location--to have a set of fallbacks for the Memory cache location:
- First, check for any explicit argument.
- If none, then use an environment variable value (e.g. `NILEARN_CACHE`).
- If none, then don't cache.

This is impairing my workflow enough that I'd like to investigate this solution a bit more.  I welcome alternate solutions / ideas / thoughts / objections :)

Ideally, in the long run, I had in mind to have the cache and the reports
next one to another. That way the user really understand that they go one
with the other, ie that the cache are intermediate files to create the
report. In the case of multiple runs of the same processing pipeline, we
could have the same cache and sub-reports. This is a bit the way FSL

I wonder if it's not something that we should worry about later.

Right now, my priority is to be able to teach a course on decoding and
functional connectivity to cognitive neuroscientist and that it flows
without any problem. Once we have this, we can iterate on providing more
value to user, including advanced user.

This is a general strategy for me: first grow the user base by getting
the API right and solving the easy problems. Then try to turn some of
these users in developers. Then start including more advanced features.

Absolutely. It's a great way of doing it. However we have to be careful
not to put all our pet peaves in nilearn.

The Memory object is coming from joblib (shipped with scikit-learn) so I am not sure we want to change Memory directly. We could use a nilearn-specific thin wrapper around it that has the logic you mention. I would probably add a bullet point to your list in 3rd position: ~/nilearn_cache or something like this if there is no explicit argument and NILEARN_CACHE is not defined.

I didn't add that third bullet, because if we did that it would change the default behavior (which is not to cache results).  It would be easy to do either way.

So what I'm thinking is to have a thin wrapper around `joblib.Memory`, and all `nilearn` functions that receive `joblib.Memory` objects will simply default to the `nilearn` default (say, `nilearn._utils.cache_mixin.Memory`, or `nilearn._utils.cache_mixin.DefaultMemory`, rather than `Memory(cachedir=None)`

At this point, I also think the `nilearn._utils.cache_mixin` module is a bit overloaded; it's already used not just for the Mixin, but caching functions.  I would suggest to rename it simply to `nilearn._utils.cache` or `nilearn._utils.caching` when this change is made.

I think that this highly depends on your usage of nilearn. The most useful caching feature, I think, is in the masker (because masking can be long). If you put all cache into one single folder, it will be simply impossible to clear. If you mask 10 datasets, you won't be able to clear the data for one dataset only.

Those are developers' concern, not really users'.

I am not fundamentally against having a `NILEARN_CACHE` directory. However, we need to find a solution to compartmentalize cache from different scripts. Otherwise I know what will happen: people will use this system, the folder will grow until it fills the hard drive, and then people will have to delete the whole thing and will lose everything.

What this enables is caching when you haven't explicitly set the cache--perhaps during script development and also nilearn testing--things that you would gladly have cached, and delete later.

None of the existing behavior changes (nothing is cached by default, and you can specify whatever Memory location you want); it just allows another capability (to cache by default to a common location, if you add an environment variable) that I am finding useful for myself.

I don't understand this, the auto-setting of the colormap would only happen when cmap is left to its default (i.e. None). If the cmap is specified then you left it unmodified.

the full colorbar, but ok, i see the idea, and will add.

up until now i was thinking that showing only one half of the colorbar
should only be done if the values are necessarily and inherently of only
one sign (eg neg log p values). and in that case one has the choice of the
sign and won't let it be negative.

This has recently come up in joblib. I suggest prepending a very short
description of the inputs to the hash in the directory name. Make
the description of the inputs both short and meaningful will not be

OK. Part of the problem will be addressed by a functionning cache
replacement policy system in joblib.

The other part of the problem is a general provenance/information problem
that is so far an open problem in software (nobody has solved it in a
good way).

That said, the relevant information is in the joblib store: in each
result directory there is a 'metadata.json'

A function to crawl such information and give a good view of the store
would probably be useful. For instance a 'list' method on the 'memory'
object, that could take an optional function as an argument (in which
case it would list only the content of the cache for this function.

I think that this would be useful. Can you open an issue on the joblib
tracker?

1. In all examples, the maskers have `""nilearn_cache""` as cache directory. We should replace that by `""nilearn_cache/dataset_name""`. Because when users realize this fact, it's already too late and they have a huge cache directory.

Yes and no: there are common things across the different datasets, and
the benefit of putting everything in the same directory is that these
common things are not duplicated or recomputed.

That's always going to be custom and never going to scale, because you
need to know which parameters should go where.

From what I hear, all these problems are problems that we cannot solve.

What we can do, is try to implement a cache replacement policy, and be
able to limit the disk occupied by caching. This is on my radar.

That works for the masker: the first level is everything but the filepath.

My guess is that people will get scared if things that used to run smoothly (because cached) become slow (because cache has been invalidated).

Yes. Loading the haxby dataset and applying to it 2 different
classifiers.

Yes, but it means that you need to hand craft this everywhere, which is
really what I am trying to avoid.

People have long stopped understanding how a computer works. There are
caching mechanisms everywhere in a computer. Some day things are fast.
Other days they are slow. The world is still a better place with caching

I was just thinking of the masker for that point.

I have no strong feeling about that. I just had several complaints about a `nilearn_cache` directory growing out of control and people not wanting to delete it by fear of losing all their cache.

OK. Point taken. I agree with you. Sorry, I was being dumb. I would
welcome a joblib cache per dataset as long as we don't have a cache
replacement policy.

That tells me we need cache replacement policy :). That's difficult work,
but it is feasible, and it will solve many problems at once.

Cool, I'll do a PR to fix that.

I agree. Adding a subdirectory to nilearn_cache is basically the idea of a two level cache but handled at user level ;). I think it can be more useful to sensibilize users to this problem rather than doing everything for them.

Supporting scikit-learn 0.10 was too expensive, and neurodebian means
that even old ubuntu install can easily get more recent versions.

No. It's a configuration that's 2 years old, and we felt that 2 years old
was a good time.

Agreed!

**To reproduce:**

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from nilearn import datasets
from nilearn.plotting import plot_roi
from nilearn.image import iter_img


msdl_atlas_dataset = datasets.fetch_msdl_atlas()
msdl_atlas_img = nibabel.load(msdl_atlas_dataset.maps)

**Notes:**
Debugging, I found that the mask is empty.  This causes `ndimage.find_objects(mask)` to return an empty list, which is then indexed with index zero.  https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/nilearn/plotting/find_cuts.py#L77 

**One question, one suggestion:**
- Question: Why is one of the masks from the dataset empty?  I didn't expect this for a dataset shipped with nilearn.
- Suggestion: Make the code more robust.  First, issue a warning (perhaps in `_plot_img_with_bg`) if plotting an empty image.  Second, handle empty images more gracefully (either skipping plotting them and asserting at the beginning of `find_xyz_cut_coords` that the data is not empty, or by handling the empty mask case directly from within `find_xyz_cut_coords`).

So... this is a probabilistic atlas, and  `plot_stat_map` is a better method to use.  

Two questions / suggestions: 
- I suggest mentioning in the `fetch_msdl_atlas` that this is a probabilistic atlas.
- I suggest mentioning how non-boolean images are thresholded in `plot_roi`, in the `plot_roi` docstring.  Indeed, I expected that images passed to `plot_roi` would plot data as `img.get_data().astype(bool)`, not this threshold approach.

1. Migrate away from `print`: Some of the code uses a `logger` object already, that wraps the `verbose` check (e.g. `nilearn/group_sparse_covariance.py`).  All of the `print` statements could be migrated to using the `logger` object, and a simple check could be made within the `logger` object to see if coveralls is being run (similar to how mock is checked within some `datasets` code, but hopefully done without having to pass a flag).  The downside is that some places in the code have more than just a `print` statement inside the `verbose` check, and this would not trigger those blocks.  And those tend to be more complex code (so in more need of test coverage).
2. Tests currently explicitly pass `verbose=0`.  They could pass import some value or function from `nilearn._utils.testing`, and pass that instead.  The value / function could do the same check as above (perhaps, an environment variable).  One downside of this is that outsiders looking to contribute would be unlikely to figure out they need to do this.

However, both have grown to accept the other type of images. `check_niimg(ensure_3d=False)` can load 4D images. `check_niimgs(accept_3d=True)` can load 3D images. This is pertinent in certain cases (eg, some sessions are represented by several 4D nifti with shape `[..., 1]`) but ATM the functions are clearly doing more than they should. Since both functions seem to converge, we may want to consider having only one function.

Issue #463 should be addressed during this refactoring.

Please discuss this matter here but use this wiki page as working document: https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/wiki/Loading-niimgs

I think that having two functions is saner because:
- the 4D would make call to the 3D function (which is better than having recurrence and `if` statements)
- some functionalities are exclusive to the 4D function (`return_iterator` for example).

I suggest to create a small wrapper function that is passed to parallel, which set the random state.  This would allow the `if...else` to choose a function (much like https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/nilearn/input_data/multi_nifti_masker.py#L176 ), which would allow only one specification of the parameters (note that `n_jobs` is hard-coded in one case here, the second time I've come across parameter inconsistencies when they're being copied).

Another reasonable option is to warn the user that the random state is being ignored.

Of course, hybrids (warn the user but still refactor the code to have one large set of generalized parameters, in addition to the `if...else` specific ones) are possible!

For scikit-learn below 0.13, it's not possible to set the random state of
FastICA. This was an oversight in the code of scikit-learn.

> note that n_jobs is hard-coded in one case here, the second time I've

Yes, because parallel computing without control of the random_state would
just duplicate the same random number generator, and thus do exactly the
same operations in each subprocess.

> Another reasonable option is to warn the user that the random state is being
> ignored.

It's not. It's actually n_jobs that is ignored.

How important is this? The impact for the user is that if scikit-learn
version is below 0.13, n_jobs is ignored, but the code works well. 0.13
came out quite a while ago, so the people that are impacted by this minor
problem are actually very few. They will be less and less as time goes.
So my gut feeling would be to ignore the problem :).

I agree!  I didn't mean to write ""bug again"" lol :)  

It does, however, mislead the user--if there is a `random_state` parameter, I expect that by using it, I'll get the same results every time.  Same with `n_jobs`--if I pass it, I expect it'll be used.

Again, happy to submit a PR that warns the user, to avoid potential confusion.  If you're still not convinced that it's worth the effort / lines of code, I'll just be quiet :)

For some reason, this does not affect the rest of the test, so perhaps something about the NeuroDebian setup causes this unexpected warning to trigger spuriously?

Can someone take a look and figure out if this is just a spurious warning, a real bug, or an issue with how we're calling FastICA?

I would ignore the warning and move on (as in: not do anything about it).
I am afraid that exposing too many parameters will simply scare away the

Second, I think that it is useful to run this test no matter the configuration. However, if it fails, it is possible to raison a SkipTestError to skip it if we really want to disable it.

For me, it is similar to the warning issue: for the moment, nilearn is in development and thus we don't have a top quality release, even if we're doing our best. This kind of concern should be raised later, for the 1.0 release for example.

I believe making `UserWarning`s throw errors is the right thing--these warnings should never be triggered in a test unless we expect to trigger them.  They're supposed to tell users something unexpected.

For now, I suggest that one of the following be done:
- Skip the test only on neurodebian (i.e. it's broken, we don't know why, but we don't want to figure it out)
- Change the test so that the warning isn't thrown (i.e. the test isn't designed properly somehow)
- Change the test to accept only that specific warning if thrown (i.e. the test is designed properly, and the warning is irrelevant).

Advice is welcome!  Note that this affects #371, as well as the `python-3.x` branch I'm finishing up.

You need to use 'add_overlay' as in the following example:

Well, just compute the overlap as an indicate on the {0, 1, 2, 3} set: 0
= non activated, 1 = map1 activated, 2 = both activated, 3 = map2
activated, and then you can use the standard plotting stack.

Yes, like in banilo example.

12,issue_comment,522,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2015-03-25 08:11:58,"Short answer: this is not possible and probably not a good idea.

Long answer: like Michael said, what you want is a 2D colorbar. This goal is usually achieved in matplotlib by using`imshow` because you can give it directly the RGB colors. However this is not possible in nilearn because, in-between, we do a lot of operations that assume that the data is scalar.
AFAIK, matplotlib still does have options to specify layer fusion method (typically, you'd like to have the multiply fusion).
So what I would (because I'm a bit lazy) is to fix the cut coords, output 2 images (red and blue) and mix the channels by using, for example, imagemagic (it,s very easy). You may also be able to do that direcrly in python by grabbing the binary representation of the plots in matplotlib (less easy).
I said that this is not a good idea because, perceptually, the color has a great influence on how we perceive things. We typically distinguish red tones better than blue tones. So if you mix them in the same image, people will have the feeling that red is stronger.Same with color mixing : if you make a 2D plot of a gradient going from red to blue, people will tend to say that it is reddish rrather than blueish. Let us know if you find a solution ;).

Alexandre, I don't think I got all your points, but I will try to find a solution and I'll keep you posted.

I understand your comments about mixing colors. However, I think that showing such overlap can be useful in many applications.

However, that would mean that the user is trying to normalize a matrix with at least one column of zeroes. Note that it is close to happening in the Oasis example, where we actually need some workaround to exclude to voxels with a zero between-subject variance from the analysis.

The correction I propose is the following:
- We catch the design problem (i.e. column(s) of zeros) early
- We raise a warning
- We use a inner mask in order to perform the analysis on the remaining, correct columns
- We return the results with zeros where there were some initially (using the inner mask again).

The convenient thing with GrowableSparseArrays is that you provide data to them, and they decide what they should store or not, depending on the threshold with which they have been initialized. The user does not have to worry about thresholding the data himself.
Besides, if the object ""knows"" what values it contains, it becomes self-content.

Here I do not agree. I think it is up to the object to select the data that it stores. that way it can be ""fed"" transparently.
Once the threshold has been set up --depending on the type of values we want the GSArray to contain-- there is nothing to do but appending data and merging GSArrays together. That behavior makes the GSArrays usable as black boxes, which is an important feature for a data structure. Would the threshold be the responsibility of the developer, it would separate the theoretical properties of the object (i.e. ""it is suppose to contain data above a given threshold"") and what happen in practice (i.e. ""is it really the case?"").

> I especially do not want it to be generic in any sense

Yet I have been asked to name its entries with generic names (""x"", ""y"", ""iter"") ;-)
(see https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/157#discussion_r9372040, and one other former comment of yours: _""I think that the ides is that the structure is fed by some iterations of a given estimator, that might be a permuted estimator.""_)

No, there can be more than one tested variate (RPBI returns a n_tested_vars by n_voxels array). But you raise a good point since I think it is not tested.

I think that I made the same remark a while ago: the object should be a
data structure that is agnostic of its usage. The thresholding thing is
something that is related to the RPBI, it should not be in the
GrowableSparseArray. The logic behind this is that the code needs to be
understandable bits by bits, and not only after reading and processing
the whole code. Thus the GrowableSparseArray should do nothing more than
be a growable sparse array.

- if none of our example uses a given dimension of the array, it has to be removed.
- If there is no scenario in which the threshold is changing, we should not even consider this possibility (actually, no user should be in position of using these structures)
- the thresholding operation has to be kept outside of the object.
  Please consider that it should be nothing but the simplest way to store and append sparse informations generated by a black box. In short, I want to it to be the minimal code that can be used to run the current examples of the library. We're not too far from that point.

To me, the lines above do not make sens: mask_img should either be a
niimg-like, or an ndarray, but it should not have both options possible.
We want to separate clearly the world of niimgs and of ndarrays.

Agreed. So we should rather test for consistency in the number of
dimensions.

10,issue_comment,505,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2015-03-19 12:10:28,"So, I fixed the failing tests during lunch.

About the changes:
- 5D images or 4D masks are NOT accepted anymore (they were valid in a few functions)
- loading of 3D or 4D niimg is now explicit. A generic `check_niimg` exists (for 3D or 4D) is however present for explicit polymorphic functions (eg smooth_img)
- A lot of tests were totally wrong in their logic. We have to be more careful about what we test

I suggest that we merge the PR as-is.

Future work:
- `concat_niimgs` is a weird thing that accepts mix of 3D and 4D images. It shouldn't do that.
- Functions to load / iterate on list of niimg would be nice. For example `check_niimgs_3d` and `check_niimgs_4d` with optional parameters to check affines and stuff.
- This PR is only about clarifying difference between 3D and 4D as it was at the beginning (with niimg and niimgs). It does not fix #463 but it should fix #501.

I wanted to throw out this code that was in a branch for a very long time but i have no time to work on the other issues.

They already are. As said before, I don't really fix bugs nor add any functionality. I just fixed the fact that check_niimg (now check_niimg_3d) only loads 3D images and check_niimgs (now check_niimg_4d) only loads 4D images. It is true that, in the meantime, I removed the ability of some functions to handle 5d data, but NiftiMasker never did for example.

If we want to support 5D images, it is easy to do that in a lot of functions (smooth_img, reorder_img...). It can be done by modifying check_niimg to accept 5d data. Oh, and it may be possible to handle in MultiNiftiMasker rather easily.

Actually, we should grab some AFNI data to test it.

Regarding the test, a bit of explanation about matplotlib.

`from matplotlib import pyplot as plt`

If you use a plotting function like `plt.plot`, the plot will be added to the current figure that you can access with `plt.gcf()`. 

So, if I take your original code and simplify it (I didn't run this code :P), we could do:

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import nibabel
import numpy as np
from nilearn.plotting import plot_glass_brain


maps_img = nibabel.Nifti1Image(np.random,random((10, 10, 10)), np.eye(4))
fh1 = plt.figure()
fh2 = plt.figure()
ax1 = fh1.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)
# Note: pl.gcf()== fh2 because it is the last figure created.
assert(pl.gcf() == fh2)
# Since we gave ax1, the figure should be plotted in fh1.
# Before your fix it was plot in fh2.
slicer = plot_glass_brain(maps_img, axes=ax1, title='test')
# Test it
assert(slicer.axes[0].get_figure() == fh1)
```

1,issue_title,357,nilearn,nilearn,bcipolli,2015-01-20 01:41:51,"This is obviously known (see, for example, https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/commit/e0f77613240be008a131da1a4a2908a6ea26713c), but not currently reflected in the `README.md` file (currently says: `Python >= 2.6`).  I suggest changing the documentation until this is fixed.

Here are the issues I've found so far; I figured it's useful to document, and I'm willing to start migrating code (and getting Travis to run tests for 2.6 and 3.4), if that's cool.

Python 2.6:
- Using string.format() with ""{}"" (`nilearn/version.py`, `nilearn/plotting/plot_glass_brain.py`)
- Using dictionary comprehensions (`nilearn/plotting/plot_glass_brain.py`)
- Using `try... except Exception, e` syntax
- Use of `nose` `assert_x` functions that are 2.7+ (see https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html)
- `assert_raises` and `zipfile.ZipFile` are not context managers until 2.7+

Python 3+:
- Using `print ""string""` (vs. `print (""string"")`)

I hadn't realized that we didn't work under Python 2.6.

I agree that, as we are start to want more users, we should worry about
compatibility with, first 2.6, and then 3.3 and 3.4.

Here is the way that I suggest tackling this issue (thanks Ben for
stepping up): first (for Python 2.6), port the ideas in scikit-learn's
.travis.yml to have the tests running under 2.6, then get it running;
submit a PR. Once the PR is in, do the same for Python 3.0.

@GaelVaroquaux One question: `scikit-learn`'s `.travis.yml` file doesn't deal with `NEURODEBIAN`.  Can you let me know how you'd like to include testing `NEURODEBIAN`?  Perhaps just on Python 2.7?  Not too familiar with it, so no idea what might make sense.

I am not sure you can use NEURODEBIAN=1 to work with python2.6. According to [this](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/ci-environment/#CI-environment-OS), Travis boxes Linux distribution is based on Ubuntu 12.04 and Python 2.6 has been dropped from 12.04 according to this [link](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Python). Just saying I am not sure how Travis python version interacts with apt-get install python-numpy for example.

Maybe you have done that already but there is a way to set-up Travis so that it builds every time you are pushing into one of your branch, which is quite useful. Pandas developers page mentions this Travis [page](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/).

Right now getting the Neurodebian GPG key fails from time to time (sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver pgp.mit.edu 2649A5A9) and we are doing it whether we are using the Neurodebian repo or not.

I started testing the plotting tools which seem very cool but ran into an issue when trying to overlay my statistical maps which are all 4D images (with the 4th dimension being different tests). I am wondering if there are plans to support slicing in loaded 4D images in the future - dumping each file to 3D individually is possible but seems a bit cumbersome.

@surchs you are more than welcome to put together an example showing how to plot 4d images with index_img and possibly iter_img.

It should go in examples/manipulating_visualizing and you can use datasets.fetch_nyu_rest (as in examples/plot_nifti_simple.py) to have a 4d image that you can then slice.

1,issue_title,458,nilearn,nilearn,bcipolli,2015-02-23 20:23:02,"I (accidentally) called `inverse_transform` on a vector of shape (n_voxels, 1).  This wound up grinding my system to a halt with the Python process consuming over 14GB.

The culprit is my error, combined with nilearn's logic for allocating memory in `_unmask_nd`:

``` python
    data = np.zeros(mask.shape + (X.shape[0],), dtype=X.dtype, order=order)
```

The only checks to this point are that X is 2D.

I'm still unclear on how much we want to hand-hold users, but avoiding this kind of issue (which can be hard to find/debug, as your system may become unstable) would be nice. 

I open this issue to discuss because I'm not sure what the preferred fix would be.  Here are two possibilities:
- I think transpose errors of vectors are the most common, and I have a simple, lightweight fix for that specific error.  
- A more general check (that one of the dimensions is equal to the # of non-zero entries in the `mask`) requires a call to `np.count_nonzero`, which though lightweight, would have to get called on every successful call of `unmask_nd`.

I would like to at least implement the first fix (and [have that available, with a test](https://github.com/bcipolli/nilearn/tree/kind_transpose_error), as I do think I'm not the only user who would make this mistake, the severity is relatively high, and it can be tough to debug.

I am :+1: for this solution. First, we don't need `count_nonzero` but `sum` since the mask is boolean. We can bench it but I think that the additional cost is negligible. If not, we could compute it once and for all in the masker (because this function will be more likely called from the masker).

- ideally, it'd be good to have a teardown equivalent of this that sets back the datasets functions to their original selves, so that each test doesn't modify the global state. I am guessing that with the current version of the code, you only need one decorated test to silence all of them.

That would seem like the right thing to do to me. Unless the purpose is
to trigger the printing code in order to test it.

To test verbosity of any function, people should write specific unit tests.

What I've done is shorthand for that.  I could use the `inspect` function to recursively search modules for functions that accept a `verbose` parameter, and I could write a teardown function as well.

This seems the most complete and safest to me.  It could also wrap `stderr` / `stdout` to test whether any function has output... in fact, doing this for the entire test suite via a `TestRunner`, rather than using a decorator, is also an option.

It does the job we want which is to reduce noise in the output of nosetests. Yes we may forget to set `verbose=0` occasionally when adding a new test, but we will probably notice eventually when either running the tests or looking at the travis-ci output.

Also as I mentioned above, it could be a way to potentially detect bugs, like the verbose parameters that aren't passed down the call stack. Let's be honest, I don't think we have so much time on our hands that we are going to unit test each of our print statements.

> To test the output directly, just don't add the decorator to the test

That's actually not true because you don't have a teardown method and you only need one decorated test with setup_silence to silence your dataset functions for all the tests that are going to run from then on. Changing the global state in tests is very very nasty.

An example of the side-effects, add this test at the end of test_datasets.py that checks that some printing on stdout actually occurs:

``` python

import sys
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def redirect_stdout(new_target):
    old_target, sys.stdout = sys.stdout, new_target # replace sys.stdout
    try:
        yield new_target # run some code with the replaced stdout
    finally:
        sys.stdout = old_target # restore to the previous value

def test_stdout_miyawaki2008():
    with redirect_stdout(open('/tmp/test', 'w')):
        datasets._get_dataset_dir('test', verbose=5)

    content = open('/tmp/test').read()
    assert_true('search paths' in content)

```

This won't pass with you current code but it will pass if you remove your setup_silence decorators (or have setup_silence be just a no-op)

What function do you want to use apart from `mean`? We don't offer that choice either in NiftiLabelsMasker. We could add it but I want to check that it's not YAGNI.

An `inverse_transform` would rise a lot of other problems, like the shape to use. Plus, I don't see why anybody would want to visualize that. We definitely need visualization for seed based experiences but correlation matrix plot is much more fit than brains in that specific case.

For my analysis, I have a mask of ventral-temporal (VT) cortex.  For each voxel in that mask, I want a ball of nearby voxels.  I will use them to compute something (right now, a similarity matrix... but could be mean, std, etc.) that I then store as the value at that voxel position. I need to do that for every voxel in that VT mask.

It is very powerful to have a vector of voxels for each slice simultaneously.  Again, this is exactly what I need for RSA, but if you have a callback function, you can do whatever you want (using global variables).  It's very powerful.

My seeds are very dense.  I want to visualize the values coming out in brain space. 

As far as the input, I also don't want to have to specify seed locations in template space, but rather through voxel indices.  Otherwise, I'll have to do the `np.tensordot` logic myself, and that is not simple at all.

> I suggest that we focus on simple behavior for the moment. Since this question is common to spheres and labels masker, we can open an issue about that and discuss it. How does it sound?

I'm absolutely all for that, in all of these cases. :)  I think there are two things to discuss (allow specification of an `xform_fn`, allow specifying a `seed_img` as input / inverse_transform on output), would be glad to open two issues.  

Note that in my RSA project, I'm already using both of the above.  For me, it's just a question of whether it's potentially useful to others, to in `nilearn`.

From my understanding, a masker is for selecting subsets of voxels.
http://nilearn.github.io/building_blocks/pipeline_introduction.html#masking
I believe this fits how all the current maskers work.

Transformers are about filtering and/or modifying the data:
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/#apis-of-scikit-learn-objects

I would expect a `NiftiSpheresMasker` to mask the data without transforming it, while a `NiftiSpheresTransformer` to mask the data, then transform it.

Generalizing the `NiftiSpheresMasker` could form the basis of the searchlight procedure, the `NiftiSpheresTransformer`, and could easily be the basis of my RSA searchlight code (which is different from the classification-focused searchlight code).

Alternately, keeping this class as implemented, but changing the name to `NiftiSpheresTransformer`, would match the existing `nilearn` and `scikit-learn` object model schema better (and make future refactoring, if needed, avoid renaming objects).

important to have a very simple story to tell to the user on what this
class is doing and what it is for, so I fear that making it more general,

That said, I agree that there could be value, in a later PR, to extract
part of the logic of this class in a set of reusable functions, that
could be later combined in a different class, eg for RSA, relying on
similar operations. From a software design principle, the idea would be
that the high-level classes exposed to the user are different, to give a
simple picture of the package to the user, but they share some underlying
code. That's one of the strong values of externalizing the core
numerical functionality in functions rather than classes.

I should probably have separated it into two parts.  One is that I think calling this a `Masker` is confusing for users; it doesn't fit with the other maskers (it transforms data, not just extracting it).   The other is about how to go about doing the abstractions.

> In general, once the NiftiSpheresMasker is merged, one could simply derive new, more targeted classes from it.

I agree, but I think it's really a `Transformer`, not a `Masker`.  I think it's best to get names right first, so good to discuss before merging.  So to repeat: I think making it a pure masker, or calling it something else (my suggestion was `NiftiSpheresTransformer`) would fit the schema of what masks are, what transforms are, and therefore much clearer for users.

OK. But I do claim that this object belong to the same family of concepts
as our other ""masker"" objects, it is very close to the NiftiLabelsMasker
of the NiftiMapsMasker.

Maybe all the ""Masker"" objects should be renamed to ""Loader"" objects.
That said, I don't see something horribly wrong with using the names
""masker"" for what we doing with them. But I admit that I can be convinced
otherwise.

The name ""Transformer"" comes from the nomenclature of scikit-learn, by
which any object is one if it exposes the method ""transform"" and thus can
be used as a pipeline step. Evidently such an informatics concept may not
overlap 1000% with the intuitions of users, but: a) The maskers DO change
the data, e.g. by detrending/standardizing and b) you can see them as the
beginning of a pipeline even if the way it acts upon data is not always
compatible with the checks performed in the scikit-learn pipeline object.

So, I have a proposition. What if I finish up the work on this one as-is and merge it. Then, we refactor the code to use a ""magic"" iterator behind the scenes, for all these classes. Something like:
`_mask_iter_img(niimgs, iter_element, mask_img=none)`
where `iter_element` is to be defined (I have ideas, but I don't want to explain all of this here as I'm not yet sure it will be feasible).

After that, advanced users like @bcipolli could directly import the iterator for their advanced code. This would factorize the code inside and the masker, and provide a useful object for methods people. However, this magic iterator being private, we don't guarantee any backward compatibility, which should not be a problem as it will only be used by advanced people (well, only by Ben and maybe Mehdi in our team I think ;)).

Well, it's more complicated than this, since we create separate axis
inside the axis you give. The way this should probably be done is to grab
the figure handle corresponding to the axis you give, use this figure
handle to create the new axes, and then hopeful everything would work.

Thanks for the tips, and very relevant--I'm hitting issues in this code with the way axes are being generated (causing matplotlib to throw errors).

I'll give it a try and update here if I'm able to use this info to overcome the current issue I've hit (using `plot_stat_map` in a subplot, passing the `axes` parameter).

```

```

I expected that it would have one of the two semantics:
1. `NiftiMasker` will detrend to compute the mask, then the detrending computed on the mask would be applied to the image passed to `transform`
2. `NiftiMasker` will detrend to compute the mask, and will not detrend input data.

Instead a third semantic was applied:
- `NiftiMasker` detrends to compute the mask.  It then detrends any image that it receives (even if that image is 3D), _using the input images only_.

I'm not sure what the designed behavior is (or why), but at the very least a warning would be helpful.  When I passed a 3D image into a masker with `detrend=True`, I got an image  back out that was all zeros.

Note: this probably also applies to standardize.

Otherwise, the functionality doesn't seem shocking to me: Every 4D image has different temporal trends that need to be removed somewhere in the pipeline. Hence semantic 1 is not useful. Semantic 2 is a possible point for confusion, which may be resolved by renaming the keyword `detrend=` to `detrend_data=`, but I am not sure whether that is necessary. The mask is always computed on undetrended images AFAIK, and both masking strategies employ mean images.

Combining masks can be done using e.g. `nilearn.masking.intersect_masks` or by working on the binary masks directly.

Scikit-learn convention forbids the use of keyword arguments in `fit` and `transform`.

I still find it odd that detrending to compute the mask, and detrending on the data passed to the transform, are semantically tied.  I'd rather have my image class know how to detrend and standardize, it doesn't seem like a ""Masking"" operation to me.  

I think I'd prefer a `normalize_img` function (that takes `detrend` and `standardize` as parameters), and use Masks for computing and applying spatial masks.

As far as I remember and as far as I can tell by skimming over the code, detrending is not performed to compute the mask, neither for `compute_epi_mask`, nor for `compute_background_mask`. Both are called from [here](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/nilearn/input_data/nifti_masker.py#L165).

>  I want the detrending computed across the entire dataset 

valid point, especially when you are extracting very few, non-contiguous conditions. The masker should actually do its job before this extraction. Otherwise you need to switch detrending off, which it is by default in order to avoid surprises.

The `NiftiMasker` is supposed to facilitate ""data preparation"" such as masking and optionally smoothing and detrending, which one often gets wrong if one applies them separately (e.g. in the smoothing case forgetting anisotropic voxel sizes)

That said, it is true that it is quite bloated with functionality.

That means that you are forcing all your users to upgrade their system
every two year, when you decide that it's time (like now). These people
want to use nilearn to solve their problem as fast as possible, and
probably don't fancy having an update to do. We need to bump dependencies
only if there is an argument for it. The old scikit-learn was a big
problem, with accumulating backports. I don't see a strong argument for
the nilearn dependency bump, but maybe there is one.

For `fetch_craddock_2012` and `fetch_localizer_calculations`, resuming is not supported. But, instead of raising error 206 saying that they do not support it, they just resend the whole file. The problem is that, on our side, we are unaware of the original size of the file and just trust the server.

Luckily, server who support resuming add a ""Content-range"" header with the size already downloaded and the total size of the file. We now rely on that header.

A good thing would be to behave like browsers : pre-allocate the size of the file and keep track of total size and already downloaded file. But that would mean to create a metadata file and a layer of complexity over the fetcher so I won't do it.

3. Lastly, I would find it helpful to specify (here or in transform) that:
   - Parameters (detrend, standardize) are computed from the images passed to transform (i.e. not computed and stored from fit)
   - Whether the inverse of these parameters is applied when inverse_transform is called (not sure if they are, for detrend, standardize, and confounds).
   
   My reasoning for this: my lab does computer vision, and the setup here differs from how our lab (and I believe others in this area) preprocess our datasets.  We compute and store whitening transforms for our training set, then apply them to test and validation sets (which are assumed to come from the same distribution of images as the training set).

I propose a refactor of the structure, to make it easier to understand. Here are the notes and proposed layout from brainstorming with @banilo and @AlexandreAbraham :
# Introduction: nilearn, how and what for?
## Nilearn: MVPA and machine learning for neuroimaging

Here: define and relate to other things that people know

Set the problem, use the right words and give our added value

Right words: functional connectivity, parcellation, connectomes, MVPA, decoding, ...

Have a table/list linking sections of the docs to different modalities (VBM, Task, resting state)

Our added value:
- very simple (a few lines of code) access to advanced methods
- we scale (fast, memory usage...)
- we enable easy prototyping for experimentation and method development
- what we provide in the wider problem of learning on brain images is
  really feature engineering
## Installing nilearn
# Decoding: predicting from brain images
## An example
## Advanced methods
# Functional connectivity and resting state
## Extracting times series to build a functional connectome
## Extracting networks: ICA and beyond
## Clustering: learning a brain parcellation
# Image manipulation and visualization
## Plotting brain images
## Loading images and NiftiMasker

Explain here that the concept of loading images doesn't really exist in nilearn: you can just pass file names to functions. Define what a niimage is
## ROIs and masks
## Datasets integrated in nilearn
- Example datasets
- Atlases
# Advanced usage: pipelines and scaling up
## Example of a hand-crafted analysis pipeline
## Caching
## Multi-core: parallel computing

Example (`decomposition/multi_pca.py`):

``` python
           data, variance, _ = cache(randomized_svd,
                                memory=self.memory,

                                memory_level=self.memory_level)(
                        data.T, n_components=self.n_components)
```

Here, the caching level of the function is given as `ref_memory_level`.
Now in `input_data/base_masker.py`:

``` python
        imgs = cache(image.resample_img, memory, ref_memory_level,
                    memory_level=2, ignore=['copy'])(
                        imgs,
                        target_affine=mask_img_.get_affine(),
                        target_shape=mask_img_.shape,
                        copy=copy)
```

The caching level is now given in `memory_level`.

It also took me time to figure out that the default value given to `ref_memory_level` and `memory_level` were put so that calling the function without specifying these parameters enables caching.

See #386 for proposition to solve this issue.

5,issue_comment,476,nilearn,nilearn,lesteve,2015-03-02 09:10:25,"First thanks a lot for removing the warnings related commits from the python 3 ones!

Here are a few general comments, before I look at the changes in more details:
- [x] we want to either use six or future but not both. Personally I'd be in favor of the latter.
- [x] we should leave the documentation generation for a separate PR. Please revert any changes to doc/sphintext.

Also this is quite a long PR to review. That would be really great if you could keep unrelated commits, like ""shorten numpy version idiom"" for separate PRs.

> All nilearn imports should be relative (except, perhaps, in tests)

not perhaps, tests should use absolute imports. For example it allows you to run a test from your git checkout with any nilearn that happens to be in your PYTHONPATH. For example this is quite useful to make sure that a test you just added was actually failing with a previous released nilearn version.

Re: the dependency on `six`, did you have any ideas o removing the dependency on `six.string_types`?  I guess I could just copy their code into a `_utils` function, but that might be confusing for developers? (e.g.  `from nilearn._utils.compat import string_types`)?

:confused: past is provided by python-future, isn't it?

I may be dead wrong but I think your tests are going to fail because 'from past.builtins import bla' are going to raise, since future is not installed any more by setup.py ...

Right, good point!  I decided to stick with `six` because it is heavily used in this PR; moving off of it would be challenging.  In addition, `sklearn` seems to be using `six`.  So that kind of made up things for me to respond to you.  But as always, willing to take a different direction if requested.

> I may be dead wrong but I think your tests are going to fail because 'from past.builtins import bla' are going to raise, since future is not installed any more by setup.py ...

The only dependency on `past` was the imports of `xrange`, and none of those should have been there anyway.  Those are all removed now, so I believe things should run well.  Let's see! :)

I haven't figured out the whole thing but I convinced myself there is something spurious going on with the coverage. For example I manually checked that some line labeled as missed were actually  executed using 1/0 markers.

A temporary work-around that I found for now: disabling doctests within nose and use the python 3 distribution in Travis.

Note that there is some known undesired interactions between coverage and doctest mentioned [here](http://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/plugins/doctests.html#source).

I'll keep investigating to find a more statisfactory long-term solution.

Not so advanced. People may copy-paste from the internets.
Why not setting the background of the _axis_ only to white or black? Advanced users will know how to revert it to another color if needed.

I honestly don't think that not handling figures with green background is a big drawback. But the rendering should be correct for default parameters at least.

Another compromise, different than the one above, is to remove the colored bounding box and move the labels a bit farther away from the brains, to avoid overlap in all reasonable cases.  

Indeed, I noticed that the padding of the bounding box is not very good above (note how the ""L"" touches the border of the brain), and in playing with that last night I settled this (bounding box still colored):

I agree it'd be nice to have better tests for plotting since at the moment we only have very limited smoke tests. I don't have a great suggestion for how to do that though. I meant to look at what matplotlib and seaborn was doing a while ago but I haven't got around to do it.

All of the plotting edge cases I'm looking at now, and things like print-to-PDF concerns, seems like important regression tests to verify before changing plotting code, but would slow down the Travis run.

There are other designs possible; for example, these types of tests could be implemented outside the `nosetests` framework.  That's just the way I've dealt with it in the past.  Very open to suggestions, but I do feel quite nervous changing plotting code without good regression tests to check that I'm not overlooking anything.

If they are not run on Travis, they will go under our radar when merging

I am very worried that adding the option to override defaults is going
overboard in terms of complexity for little benefits. This is going to be
of interest to a absolutely tiny fraction of users and it brings more
code lines, and more ways of putting the plotting code in corner cases,
and thus forcing us to add even more complexity. I think that we must
limit the amount of customization: after all, it doesn't bring that much
to the average user, who wants to do simple analysis and plotting of
data.

I agree, but this capability is already there--all of these functions take `kwargs`.  In my (admittedly uncertain) testing, this didn't work well for the existing functionality.

My real reason for doing this was that the args passed to the `ax.text` function was duplicated for `L` and `R` labels, and they got out of sync (one was passed with `alpha`, the other was not).  In refactoring that code, I noticed that switching the order of where `kwargs` was added gave the opportunity to override.  No need to even mention it, but it's there.

> it brings more code lines

I believe it actually reduced the number of lines and chances for real bugs, as the parameters passed for setting text are consistent between ""L"" and ""R"" labels.  Duplicating that logic elsewhere for consistency added 1-2 lines in 2 other places, but it's either a wash or slightly shorter overall.

No biggie either way to me.

Agreed. I guess my comment was with the above plot in mind where the colorbar vmin will be above the threshold (by construction there will be no value in the glass brain below the threshold). You are right that you could pass vmin=0 to plot_glass_brain in which case it would make sense to show the threshold.

it should be possible to denote the meaning of those colors.  The universal
way would be with a customizeable and label-able colorbar (labels meaning
both the numeric or categorical ticks but also the colorbar title (e.g. ""t
stats"" or ""COPES"" ).  This goes for every single plot/image/graphic
function within nilearn, not just plot_glass_brain or plot_stat_map.
(2) Yes, it's a max intensity projection, and we should know what those
intensities are- quantitatively.
(3) Since so much functionality is already built in to plot_glass_brain
(e..g., change color map, apply threshold, and apply min/max to colormap),
a logical and needed extension to make sure a viewer, not someone with the
code, understands what they see, is to encapsulate the numerical
description of the colors.  Otherwise, almost literally, I could set these
parameters and come up with very different displays.  Note that vmin and
vmax, are crucial for comparing separately plotted brains.
(4) Without a colorbar, what could have been one of the most useful
functions for exploratory brain analysis, precisely because three cuts
would show a lot of any possible activity as opposed to needing many
slices, becomes a novelty rather than a research tool.  My two step
workflow was glass_brain to get a sense of where things are and then
specific cuts for exactly the reason that you mentioned- cuts are need to
precisely localize the activity.
(5) To ease the nilearn plotting user communities transition to nilearn
plotting commands from matplotlib plotting.  It seemed natural that all
matplotlib functionality would be inherited by any nilearn plotting
commands- that actually is what led me to try vmin and vmax and colormap
changing.

Behind the scenes, emotional appeal story:  I'm an experienced matlab user,
who could have replicated much of the plotting I needed in matlab in less
time than it took me to figure out any one of the steps needed to actually
plot an image, using just matlab and and the brain load command from spm.
I also fully admit that I don't have the cool background template for
plot_glass_brain, and some other functionality in nilearn.  My research
adviser is a matlab to python convert, and strongly pushes python and its
community, so I've been giving it a good faith try this past semester.
Yet, I constantly run up against features that _almost_ work perfectly in
the python ecosystem.  I commend you and all the developers for this
toolbox, and the many, many others out there.  It's fantastic that there is
such a vibrant opensource scientific computing community.  I just want you
to know that matlab is that standard to which I'm holding python for
visualization.  You'll know you (as in the python community) has won me
over when I hold matlab's functionality to the python standard.

This is false as some parts of the code were made with Nifti1Image in mind. For example, using an object exposing the right methods but also `__iter__()` will make `check_niimg` fail.

Example iterable object:

``` python
import numpy as np
from nilearn._utils.niimg_conversions import check_niimg


class Niimg(object):

    def get_data(self):
        return np.ones((10, 10, 10, 5))

    def get_affine(self):
        return np.eye(4)

    def __iter__(self):
        for i in range(5):
            yield np.ones((10, 10, 10))

check_niimg(Niimg())
```

Commenting this code in niimg_conversions makes it work. In fact, we can't make assumptions on the data based on the presence of an `__iter__` method.

``` python
    if hasattr(niimg, ""__iter__""):
        pass
        #if ensure_3d:
        #    raise TypeError(""A 3D image is expected, but an iterable was""
        #        "" given: %s"" % short_repr(niimg))
        #if hasattr(niimg, ""__len__"") and len(niimg) == 0:
        #    raise TypeError('An empty object - %r - was passed instead of an '
        #                    'image or a list of images' % niimg)
        #return concat_niimgs(niimg)
```

This code has to be replaced by proper checks, and we should maybe make a pass on the code to be sure that it does not happen elsewhere.

I think the outcome was that nested classes wasn't good practice, and we found a case where pickability was broken. Good enough for me to drop it. Also adding an underscore in front of the class name, namely using _Checked4DImageIterator makes me happy enough about the whole thing.

No, it's definitely good policy. With this code it becomes much harder to
introspect or to pickle (pickle is pretty much based on reflexivity, and
this breaks reflexity)

From my understanding of Python scopes, you shouldn't be able to pickle the result of iter_img (the iterator itself) but I can be wrong.

I have no strong feeling. I just prefer classes outside of functions for the sake of readability. I honestly didn't think of people trying to pickle iterators.

Modal functions are not good for API. Users tend to get them wrong.

Aside from making the code simpler, I don't see a benefit of the greedy
loading.

It's for everywhere. One example: if I need to load a resting-state data,
but discard the first 3 images.

Ah! Your remark applied to check_niimg and not to index_niimg? Then I
mostly agree with it that two modes could be useful. My remark does apply
here, as it is a developer-oriented function.

1. we are at version 0.1, not 1.0. We are doing our best to provide high quality code but things are not fixed and we can't impose such high requirements on quality for now.
2. spurious warning may rise depending on versions of packages. For exemple, using an old sklearn with newest numpy/scipy raises a lot of DeprecationWarning. Not sure how robust it is to catch'em all.

I tested this code with https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/397 (minver of sklearn as 0.12.1) and with  https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/470 (mutipca / masker interaction), to make sure these changes worked with them.  They do.  I then pulled those commits from this branch, so that this can be merged independently.

The last commit is the one I'm least confident about.  I think the goal is the right one (users shouldn't see warnings for using our functions, it's confusing), but the implementation is not happy (suppressing all of those warnings after nilearn is loaded).  I would prefer to be less broad, but that would require more distributed code, and ... this is my current proposed compromise.

I've also opened up https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/471 for one final issue that I have been investigating.  I think that can be dealt with separately, so this should be ready for review.

17,issue_comment,371,nilearn,nilearn,lesteve,2015-02-02 22:10:16,"Before I start looking at the details of this PR, here are a few general comments:
- I am -1 on the UserWarning (or any kind of warnings for that matter) promoted to errors. It just seems to much of a burden on us to make sure that no warnings are issued for a wide range of numpy, scipy and scikit-learn versions for very little benefit IMHO. It makes sense every once in a while to look at the nosetests output and try to reduce the warnings coming from within the nilearn code but that's where I would stop. Maybe @GaelVaroquaux and @AlexandreAbraham can give their opinion too.
- it would be very nice if a few commits were removed in order to make this PR only about warnings. I am thinking mostly about cache_mixin.py -> cache.py renaming and ref_memory_level vs memory_level. Both of them deserve their own issue and/or PR.

I put together a hack to silence warnings within nose, if that can make people happier by reducing the noise when running the tests locally. Trust me it wasn't easy as I hoped and I tried a few dead-ends before getting something that actually worked. Put the following code in a script somewhere in your PATH and use it rather than nosetests:

``` python
#!/path/to/your/python

from nose import main
import warnings

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with warnings.catch_warnings(record=True):
        # catch_warnings with record=True is going to silence the warnings
        # by actually redefining warnings.showwarnings.
        # Depending on your use case you may want to uncomment the following line
        # warnings.simplefilter('ignore')
        main()
```

By the way I didn't know about the PYTHONWARNINGS environment variable. Definitely something to remember when trying to figure out where some pesky warnings come from (turn them into errors and look at the stacktrace).

Goes without saying but given that it took me a while to get something that was fulfilling its promise of removing all the warnings, I thought I would share for people who want a quick and dirty way to have nice and tidy nosetests outputs.

Just to be clear: it is not on by default in the production code.  It is turned on during testing only.

23,issue_comment,371,nilearn,nilearn,bcipolli,2015-02-05 06:35:58,"@lesteve @GaelVaroquaux A bit about my thinking here, and why I support throwing errors IN TESTS if unexpected warnings are thrown.

The goal here isn't just to clean up the output of tests.  It's that warnings hide potential bugs, and debugging warnings (and potential bugs) is much more laborious after the fact than it is at the time the warning is introduced.

If the goal is to eventually look into warnings, throwing on new warnings will make debugging things much easier.  Deferring will make the debugging harder, and will hide bugs--I found about 5 bugs in nilearn that I fixed in this PR that were hidden by warnings (including the caching issue that @AlexandreAbraham worked up properly).  I don't see any benefit of deferring here... to me it's the same benefit as having automated builds run through Travis.

In addition, it's my personal principle that warning output to the user should be carefully controlled.  Having strong expectations that tests either intentionally trigger warnings and validate them (lack of validation was causing some of the output), or do not trigger warnings at all (the default for tests), helps make this happen. It's a useful tool.  That doesn't have to be the principle here, but it's how I approached things in this PR.

Lastly, if the concern is that `sklearn` or others will throw lots of unexpected warnings... two responses: (1) We should all really hope that's not the case, that would suck for `nilearn`'s users.  If it is the case, however, I think we have some responsibility to see it ahead of time and mitigate it where possible. (2) It's so easy to turn the code to throw with warnings in the tests, if it becomes a problem... turn it off!

As of now, I've done the work to clean things up.  I think there's big benefits to keeping it that way, and not a lot of downside.  It's about avoiding bugs, keeping on top of potential issues, and making sure that users only get warnings when we really want them to.

That's not our workflow. We like to work based on PR. The github
interface makes this very easy to do. The benefit is that looking at the
whole PR makes it harder to miss something like the introduction of a

Yeah basically this was the oldest six version that got the test passing on my machine without having to change code.

For completeness:

I'd be happy to help push this forward.  I can take care of the merge conflicts and take care of the printing / verbose issues, for example.  I also think the coding of the `plot_haxby_rpbi` example could be simplified.    

I also had a couple of questions about analysis choices made in the `plot_haxby_rpbi` example.  I worry that my questions / concerns may be naive (I am still very new to neuroimaging analysis), but I will follow up with them in case they're questions others might have in learning from the examples.

  - Would this be (at least partially) alleviated by passing `detrend=True` in the mask?

Probably, but the extent depends on long range temporal interactions (which are typically drift components) that are difficult to quantify

> Is this really a concern in a block design (24s per stimulus, 12s of rest in-between)?

Drift cutoff in nipy GLM is set by default to a period of 128s. If the interactions are really that long, then this would be a concern. 

> Would this be (at least partially) alleviated by passing detrend=True in the mask?

Probably. But as mentioned elsewhere, this detrending needs to be done by chunks (as indicated by the `chunk` variable in the label data)

Thanks @eickenberg ; I can perhaps include some of that in the example (like the detrending in chunks), and a bit more in comments.  I also think the code can be cleaned up a bit (after working through the example for some of the RSA-focused work I'm doing).

From a little bit of reading it looks like:
1. the landscape report is done as a comment. When the same thing was enabled for coveralls, people were pretty annoyed by the automatic emails that ensued each time somebody pushed into a PR branch.
2. there is a landscape.io github [issue](https://github.com/landscapeio/landscape-issues/issues/108) about using the github status API which is far less intrusive but not sure how likely this is going to happen in the near future.

OK I just wanted to make sure that all the plt.scatter/plt.plot functionalities were available. We can have the main useful arguments as parameters of the function like node_color and node_size and still keep node_kwargs and edge_kwargs for the additional ones.

although related that's not exactly the same thing. Having said that the patch in #379 may just work for this use case because the threshod is 0. In any case I propose to tackle the colorbar once this first iteration on the connectome plotting is merged.

What's wrong with just grey? Other option is that by default you put the
z coordinate as a node color. But I think that this will just confuse
users, and I suggest that by default there is a grey color.

For the example, you can make it prettier by plotting the index of the
node in the default ordering of the atlas.

Admittedly I have very little idea how people look at these plots but I assumed that at the very least you want to be able to identify a given node across the three views in which case having a slightly separate color for each node seems like a good idea.

If I understand your index suggestion correctly I think that is close to what I have in mind.

That's not the way I usually work with these: the location in the brain
tells me enough. But I see your point.

Combined with some form of colorbar for nodes that links a color to a
name, it would be great. However, let's leave that for a second PR.

I think that you are unto something very interesting. I usually find that
plotting only half an hemisphere can be very useful. I'd rather go for
that than something more general, which will be harder to use for the end
user, and harder for us to code.

No. I've just had last week someone who was using Python in 3D slicer.
Installing any package was quite a lot of work for that person. I am
still trying to limit as much as possible the dependencies, including in
the examples.

However, in a later work, I think that we could integrate such function
in nilearn.plotting. But later.

Yes. I can see a design where there would be an Axes that projects to the
left hemisphere and one to the right. As in 'R', 'L'. We'll brain storm
about this later.

+1 for having an option 'node_color=""depth""'. In a later PR.

Do you want to add 2 enhancements tickets for these features? I think
that they are good ideas.

I think that we should use 'format'. It's the new recommended way of
doing things. I am myself not doing it out of habit, because I started
doing Python before it existed, but that's a bad thing.

Keeping a local version doesn't mean that we will branch. The idea is to
have a synchronization script that copies exactly the sphinx-gallery code
in the projects that use it. In these projects it should never be
modified. One example of this pattern is how joblib is integrated in
scikit-learn, in sklearn/externals.

> Isn't it better to use the git version installed in develop mode more

More practical for you. It raises two problems. One is of technicality.
It's one more thing to learn and master for a contributor. These things
pile up and make it harder and harder to contribute to a project. The
second problem is that it means that any backword incompatible change or
bug introduce in sphinx-gallery will break the projects using it.
Decoupling is a good thing.

:+1:. We cannot have a joblib dependency.

I would actually favor not using joblib but a simple shelve, and a test
to see if the URL is already in the shelve.

Here is some pseudo code to implement what I have in mind:

<pre>
import shelve
mem = shelve.open('foo')
if not url in mem:
    data = get_url(url)
    mem[url] = data
    mem.sync()
else:
    data = mem[url]
</pre>

I'd rather not. Creeping dependencies are a problem, and we must tackle
them. The pseudo code that I have given demonstrates how easy it is to
use shelve.

I guess it's up to each project to make a choice whether they want to ship sphinx-gallery or not. The main point of doing so is pure convenience for people generating the doc.

About sphinx-gallery evolving separately in different projects, there is an implicit agreement that only released versions of sphinx-gallery should be used and that potential changes should be propagated upstream.

> I was having a look at the scikit-learn externals. It is a static set of code that gets updated manually, why? and why the extra install scripts within that module?

I guess convenience again is the main reason. Users are spared having to install a few packages in order to use scikit-learn. I think the technical term is vendorizing, you may want to see what the internet has to say about it. I didn't know about the extra install scripts in external so I can't help on this one.

Publishing sphinx-gallery as 0.0.7 with the shelve is straight forward, can upload to pypi now. But I wouldn't launch it yet as a stable release. As some to do from @GaelVaroquaux are still missing. https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/issues/20
Moreover I want to test a bit longer on the configuration dictionary key naming, test the nametuple as well. Since after a stable release one shall not change the user interphase.

Fair enough, how long do you need roughly to be reasonably confident there is no major issues?

Because sphinx-gallery is not used massively at the moment backward-incompatible changes are not such a big deal I would say.

- a sphinx-gallery release with the shelve functionality (maybe it has already happened I haven't checked)
- a script to update the nilearn sphinx-gallery copy similary to what is done for joblib in scikit-learn. TBH, it would be fine to have a simple copy as a first step and work on this script in a separate PR.

I think your comments are related to sphinx-gallery and not nilearn. I reckon we should merge this PR. The alternative is for your comments to be addressed in sphinx-gallery and a new sphinx-gallery release to be made before we can merge this PR. This seems a little bit too much overhead for what it is worth IMHO.

Just for clarity we'll try to keep the sphinx-gallery copy inside nilearn in sync with the latest sphinx-gallery release going forward, which means that if your comments get addressed in sphinx-gallery they will eventually reach the nilearn sphinx-gallery copy.

The good: no extra package to install to generate the doc for nilearn, scikit-learn, and other packages users that have scikit-learn installed.

The not that great: a tiny bit of scikit-learn specific code for projects that are potentially unrelated. 

I was thinking something along those lines (but with a better error message):

``` python
try:

    try:
        from sklearn.externals import joblib

Actually not such a fair point, since the import joblib would work for the sphinx-gallery CI but I agree the shelve solution doesn't seem so hard and is the right way to do it.

**Expected behavior:**
`check_niimgs` called on an iterator of 3D images to return all images.

**Current behavior:**
`check_niimgs` returns a list, or iterator, with the first image missing.  The output from the above:

```
[<nibabel.nifti1.Nifti1Image object at 0x10b3eaf10>]
[]
<type 'exceptions.StopIteration'>
```

**Notes:**
- I'm not sure what use-cases this would hit.  I expected `mean_img` to call `check_niimgs`, but it does not, nor am I clear when an iterator would be passed to `check_niimgs`.
- When `check_niimgs` runs, it grabs the first image to examine image information.  In the case of an iterator, however, it simply returns the remaining iterator (not a new one that contains the first image that's been popped off.
- I'm not sure the best way to fix this.  Issue #462 was an accidental product of me trying to find a solution to this issue.

Note this has been the case for a while, and is not specific to the relatively recent return_iterator=True in check_niimgs. To make matters worse, I wasn't able to find tests with check_niimg(s) and iterators.

A couple of examples I just found:

``` python
import numpy as np
from nibabel import Nifti1Image

from nilearn import _utils

affine = np.eye(4)
img_3d = Nifti1Image(np.ones((10, 10, 10)), affine)

img_4d = _utils.check_niimgs(input_iterator)  # Exception in concat_niimgs

input_iterator = iter([img_3d, img_3d])
img_4d = _utils.check_niimg(input_iterator)
img_4d.shape  # (10, 10, 10, 1) instead of (10, 10, 10, 2)

We need to make a choice. Too many options are detrimental. It should
probably be 'pre application', because these are the only semantics that
make sens in general. However, this will blend a bit the masked data with
the non masked data in the case of time filtering, so we will have to

timecourse_mask would be another option.

however, the axis we are referring to can be more general than time. we
could also select conditions with it for decoding, see e.g. the haxby

Indeed, in a GLM, but we have typically done decoding directly on the data.

My point is that one could use the ""Time Masker"" to mask conditions here. However, since these data are still temporally structured, the example is bad. If you consider a dataset consisting of many beta maps (such as an event-related paradigm), the is nothing time-related at all involved, but one may still be tempted to use the ""Time Masking"" to select images according to certain conditions.

Hence my proposition to use a name that is more general than the word ""time"", e.g. ""sample"". That said, I have no problem using something that has the name ""time"" in it on my non-temporal 4th axis.

Possible. The real argument is that it's data dependent (ie has a shape
in n_samples) thus giving it at build-time break cross validation.

The indexing/slicing PR does make things much easier. However, suppose
that you want, eg to remove the 3 first volumes. With Danilo's PR, it is
trivial to do this in a pipeline, in distributed computing. Manually
using slicing would require more work.

However, the slicing PR should be merged, and then this PR updated to use
it.

If Loic's slicing PR permits slices into memmapped .nii files, then that is the best possible way of saving memory.

So the sole advantage of having time slicing (once Loic's is merged) in the NiftiMasker is the fact that it can go in a pipeline.

Not sure what you mean by that, it seems to be that indexing does create a temporary 4D image but maybe I am missing something.

and another thing about:

> All nilearn imports should be relative (except, perhaps, in tests)

I seem to remember the scikit-learn policy was to use absolute import in tests. I guess this way you can easily run the test file independently from the package it is coming from, say run a test from your scikit-learn git checkout with an older version of scikit-learn for example.
",,
8,issue_comment,378,nilearn,nilearn,bcipolli,2015-02-01 19:38:22,"I read up on most of the rest of the test failures--they are due to string handling differences between Python 2 and 3 and relatively heavy usage (compared to `sklearn`) in `nilearn` of numpy's `loadtxt` and `recfromtxt` functions without specifying column dtypes, and `nilearn`.

`numpy` has chosen to always return `loadtxt` and `recfromtxt` strings without types as bytes.  However, string literal defaults in Python are version dependent: Python 2 defaults strings to bytes, and Python 3 defaults to unicode.

This fails when in `nilearn` we explicitly filter based on condition masks using string literals, e.g. 

``` python
haxby_dataset = datasets.fetch_haxby_simple()
conditions = np.recfromtxt(haxby_dataset.conditions_target)['f0']
condition_mask = np.logical_or(conditions == 'face', conditions == 'house')
```

This will succeed in Python 2, but fail in Python 3.  In Python 2, the `'f0'` column is bytes (default), the condition mask `'face'` is bytes, so the comparison succeeds.  In Python 3, the `'f0'` column is bytes (default), the condition mask `'face'` is unicode, so the comparison fails.

One solution could be to specify all string literals as bytes, e.g. `b'face'`.  This is what `sklearn` does, but they don't use `loadtxt` nor `recfromtxt` in user-facing examples.  I think it'd be weird to use these byte literals in examples, especially when most users won't need to know about it (only those using Python 3.x).

Another solution could be to write our own `loadtxt` and `recfromtxt` functions that call `numpy`'s version, then convert any string fields to unicode by calling `decode()` on the strings.  I dislike wrapper functions like this because those familiar with `numpy` may no longer read the examples as clearly (similar, but different function is called....)

A final solution is to repackage the dataset code (where most of this info lies) more carefully, such that the column definitions and datatypes are part of the package.  I think this is the best option--we have that information (we spent the time to curate these datasets), and it would allow better column names (we could use `'condition'` instead of defaults like `'f0'`), but it would take some thinking about how to package that information well.

My suggestion: implement our own wrappers for `loadtxt` and `recfromtxt` and use them in our examples.  If there's interest in the third one, I can open an issue for it.

If no objections, I'll start on solution #2 on Tuesday.  Thanks!

Good point indeed. We can specify that the inverse transform always
return the data in the space of the atlas unless an explicit affine is
passed. These are consitent semantics (in the sens that they offer little
surprises). They may lead to memory explosions, but note that
inverse_transform will be used by much less people than transform (it is
a less common case). Also, the memory explosion is more obvious because
it occurs via the size of the output created by the function. In the
current case, it is harder to guess, as it occurs in an intermediate
variable.

6,issue_comment,340,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2015-01-15 09:55:49,"This is not as easy as it seems. In fact, it brings inconsistencies to the masker as the affine is defined in the transform rather than the fit. For example:

``` python
masker = NiftiLabelsMasker(labels_img, resample_target='data')
masker.fit()

# First dataset, target_affine is set to affine_data_1
data1 = masker.transform(dataset1)

# Second dataset, target_affine is set to affine_data_2
data2 = masker.transform(dataset2)

# Inverse transform, my data has been resampled into dataset2 space
masker.inverse_transform(data1)
```

We could say that the affine is defined on the first transform, but I find this misleading. We could also say that the `target_affine` is defined by the data given in the `fit` but it would conflict with mask computation and also be misleading compared to the behavior of the classical NiftiMasker.

I would be more in favor of accepting niimgs in the `resample_target` parameter.

The problem is not the `transform` step, it is the `inverse_transform`. If resampling is done on heterogenous data, how do we chose the affine when `inverse_transforming`? For me, it is better to explicitely give an affine (or a niimg which has the desired affine).

I think we can consider resampling the atlas as costless. Given that masking is usually done once and cached, it doesn't bother me if there is a small overhead per process.

**Stronger suggestions:**
- `n_subjects` is defined midway through the file and not used.  I suggest to move the definition to the top of the file (where other editable parameters are defined), and to pass it to the call to `datasets.fetch_adhd`
- The `NiftiMapsMasker` is constructed on every loop, and `fit_transform` is used.  This suggests to the user that the mask depends on the input data, but it does not.  I suggest moving the masker construction out of the loop, and calling `fit` with no parameters.

**Milder suggestions:**
- An atlas is used to create the connection matrix, but is never shown.  I suggest showing the atlas to the user, as the connection matrices are uninterpretable without it.  Or, probably much better, plot the centroids of the ROIs on a single mask via the (coming!) connectome plotting.
- `verbose` is passed to some functions, but not others (GraphLassoCV).  Add it to all.

- It is possible to completely turn off output.

**Current behavior:**
- A number of dataset download functions print, even at `verbosity=0`

**Notes:**
Currently, the tests print a lot of output during testing.  This makes viewing test output very challenging--I have to search/scroll for error information, and even getting to the final output requires a lot of scrolling.

Either:
- Define a schema for what verbosity means (0=silent, 1=errors, 2=warnings, 3=standard user output, 4=debug info, etc.), and use it

- Instead of passing a verbosity, pass a logger from the `logging` module.
- Create a `nilearn._utils.logger` object in the `nilearn._utils.__init__' file, that will be the default logger.

I would prefer the second solution; I think anyone wanting to actually manipulate the logging would either know the `logging` module, or would ""get"" it pretty quickly (it's not hard)

Again, this is a developer-side feature that I'm happy to implement in order to make my own life easier.

Agreed.

This is wrong and should not be like this, indeed (but for long-running
function, default should be to print some sane progress, and thus default
should not be verbose=0).

>   • Define a schema for what verbosity means (0=silent, 1=errors,

Well, this is the standard logging behavior in Python, but this is not
what we want, as we want also an indication of progress. verbosity=1
should display a bit of progress, verbosity=2 more,... This is important
when running a lot of computation/long run jobs. Also, we use a pattern
of decreasing verbosity when combining methods one into the other. That
way the progress of each nested for loop can always be seen.

Also, warnings and errors should always be displayed unless they are
absolutely harmless. We need user to see these.

> I would prefer the second solution; I think anyone wanting to actually

This is not the way I see it. Only geeks know the logger module. Beside,
it does not implement well the pattern of decreasing verbosity, which is
really useful.

Definitely.

For those that are not right. But when you do this, check that the
default verbosity is still meaningful, ie that long-running operations
still print a bit of progress by default.

Granted. It just requires touching the same lines, and thus would raise

We do not want to be using this by default in the continuous integration,

useful.

Yes, we have had this in the workshop also. It clearly seems to me that

You can see it easily: with `low_pass=0.5` you get the expected behavior (signal is the same, `Wn=1.`). But with `low_pass=0.501` you can see that the filter goes completely crazy.

The following code to cache does not cache:

``` python
from nilearn._utils.cache_mixin import cache

def my_fun(X, Y)
     return X + Y
Z = cache(my_fun, memory='nilearn_cache')(1, 1)
```

Instead, the call must be:

``` python
Z = cache(my_fun, memory='nilearn_cache', func_memory_level=1, memory_level=1)(1, 1)
```

I suggest tweaking the semantics of `func_memory_level`, such that if `func_memory_level is None`, everything gets cached.  Put it this way: if you call `cache` without specifying a `func_memory_level`, you always want it cached--rather, than _never_ cached.

Alternately, I would like the function to raise a warning if `func_memory_level is None`.  Since `func_memory_level is None` currently means the result will  _never_ be cached, it shouldn't have been wrapped at all.. and so clearly the user's confused about the design, and we can warn them.

I would be glad to submit a PR on this, but wanted to open things to discussion first.

You don't expect but yet it is the expected behavior ;). We certainly don't want to cache things if the user does not explicitely specify it. The `cache` function is a helper function, it is here to avoid doing an `if` statement each time we have to call a function that can be cached. You can see it as a `joblib.Memory(cachedir=None)`.
",,
4,issue_comment,457,nilearn,nilearn,bcipolli,2015-02-23 22:00:47,"Using the `cache` function explicitly is the user specifying it.  Within the `nilearn` codebase, ``func_memory_level` is never `None`... or the call to `cache` should simply be removed, as no user input could ever cause anything to be cached.

It seems strange to have a case where you can have a case where you wrap something in `cache`, and it can never lead to cached results (when `func_memory_level` is `None`).  Why allow that?  Am I missing a use-case above?
",,
5,issue_comment,457,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2015-02-23 22:14:06,"`cache` is hidden in the `_utils` package and thus should not be called directly by the user. But I get your point, you say that `func_memory_level` should not be optional since caching is triggered by `memory` and `memory_level`.
OK, let's do it then ;).
",,
6,issue_comment,457,nilearn,nilearn,bcipolli,2015-02-23 22:25:39,"I guess I'm suggesting to make `cache` available to users, not an internal API.  Easy, ubiquitous caching is a great feature in `nilearn`, and making `cache` as a user function.

I am finding `cache` to be extremely useful.  It's interface is more consistent with how caching is done throughout `nilearn`, and makes for more concise code.  If it's too much trouble for users to pass a `joblib.Memory` object to functions, why ask them to use joblib to do any caching on their own?

Looking at the code again, I think setting both to zero by default is simplest and meaningful--if you call `cache` with no args, it means you want to cache it, always.  Adding `None` in the loop simply forces an extra check (`is None`) with no semantic addition.

8,issue_comment,457,nilearn,nilearn,bcipolli,2015-02-23 22:50:26,"I think nilearn is doing something in-between.  On the one hand, it allows passing strings as a ""memory"", and there's some concern for allowing users to clear the cache (so cache management and abstracting away from joblib).  On the other hand, apparently `cache` is an internal function--so to cache any of their own stuff, users have to use joblib.

I'd like to see it become more consistent--either push users to joblib.Memory, or give them more succinct, abstracted alternatives.  My vote is to create a  `nilearn.caching` module and exposing `cache` to users, then make the `cache_mixin` class work on top of that.

The proposal resulting from that discussion is more of a copying mechanism, similar to `np.zeros_like` and `np.ones_like` where properties of the input image are copied except if other values are specified in the keyword arguments. The key point of that discussion is _which_ attributes to copy, because some of them are data dependent in different ways.

The contribution here could maybe be used as the analogous diagnostic tool for anybody who relies strongly on header information. In this case, just as in the discussion in #380, different modes of comparison may be possible depending on the context one is working in.

That is the only use case I can think of right now and I am not sure it is valid.

c) Fundamentally, nifti = data + header (includes affine), not nifti = data + affine (header is a blackspot). It would make sense to account for this reality in the API

In `iter_img`, we copy the header of the image to the _sub_images_. As Gaël stated, we do that for now, but we have no clear idea of what's contained in the header. Since we don't have clear ideas on that, I think we don't want to integrate code like that. Honestly, I don't feel comptetent enough regarding nifti headers to tell if it's a good idea or not.

It seems important to at least use movement confounds and their temporal derivatives, as well as the instantaneous variance (squared signal) of both. These account for approximately the same subspace that is spanned by the first high variance confounds (usually 5, but may get to 20 or more), but are less demanding from a computational point of view.

After subtraction of the [augmented matrix of] movement confounds and the first 5 high variance confounds, the connectivity matrix---represented by the precision matrix of the clean time series, i.e., the time series with the confounds regressed out---seems sufficiently sparse in almost all cases.

I propose this outline:
1. What do you use in nilearn?
2. What problems did you encounter? Did you find a workaround by yourself?
3. What do you want to see in nilearn in the future
4. Comments on nilearn in general (what you like / don't like...)
# What do you use in nilearn?
- `_utils.check_niimg`
- `NiftiMasker`
- `plotting.*`
- `datasets.*`
# What problems did you encounter? Did you find a workaround by yourself?
## CanICA

Given my pipeline, it was more practical for me to use CanICA directly on masked data. To do that, I copied the code in my repo and remove all that was related to masking. I tried to give a fake mask to use it (of shape `(n_voxels, 1, 1)`) but Nifti1Image does not allow it.

After Andres' presentation, I wanted to try using Ward to compress data before ICA and compare it to a simple smoothing. Again, I can't do that in nilearn: NiftiLabelsMasker are not accepted in CanICA.
## MultiNiftiMasker

I don't find the caching system of the MultiNiftiMasker practical. Therefore I use a NiftiMasker with a loop and I cache the data myself. But this is specific to my needs since I move the data on several machines.
## Nifti1Image

This class is horrible. I created my own Niimg class a while ago. It supports indexing, iteration, and modification. It also does a bit more (like on the fly unmasking and weak references) but this is more specific to my usage. It also contains the id of the subject which is helpful to retrieve phenotypic information for example.
# What do you want to see in nilearn in the future

I am very enthuastic about some upcoming plotting features. This is really useful. We are also on our way to integrate new models which is definitely a big plus for reproducible science. I'm also waiting for the report features and notebook examples.
# Comments on nilearn in general (what you like / don't like...)

I am a bit frightened about the growth of the maskers in term of functionalities (time masking) and types (balls masker). In fact, adding options and increasing their number may lead to maintenance issues as each one has its own implementation.
And in general, the most annoying thing is to have to import nibabel and create a new Nifti1Image everytime I need to modify something in the data.

3,issue_comment,361,nilearn,nilearn,salma1601,2015-01-23 23:56:23,"**What do you use in nilearn?**
I used NiftiMapsMasker and datasets.
**What problems did you encounter? Did you find a workaround by yourself?**
From my naive point of view as a beginner in programming, I am frustrated with joblib. I rerun the Masker with different parameters without specifying different memory locations and I end up with a huge memory size of a series of files I never exploited because I don't know to which subject/set of parameters they correspond. Plus I had to move the root folder containing joblib and I had the impression that the cached files were no longer recognized.
A different minor point is that I wanted to explore non standardized signals within my ROIs but the function signal.clean forces normalization of the input signals. I'm rather used to scaling the signal to its average across timepoints (PSC units). 
**What do you want to see in nilearn in the future**
I would like to have a hrf so that to deal with connectivity during task.
**Comments on nilearn in general (what you like / don't like...)**
I like in nilearn the excellent code quality: one can go into it and understand quickly what it does. But I feel like in the user guide and the given examples the stress is put on the model but not on the neuro point of view. For instance I expect regions or at least networks to be explicit on a connectivity matrix plot for real data.
",,
4,issue_comment,361,nilearn,nilearn,bthirion,2015-01-26 21:47:56,"_What do you use in nilearn?_
 NiftiMasker (mostly), visualization; get back to the examples when running clustering, ICA etc.

_What problems did you encounter? Did you find a workaround by yourself?_
Most of them have been fixed in the course of time. 

_What do you want to see in nilearn in the future_
I'd like to see it become a complete suite for volume-based (as opposed to surface-based) data analysis: design matrix, GLM, group statistics.
Up-to-date dictionary learning.

",,
5,issue_comment,361,nilearn,nilearn,eickenberg,2015-01-27 13:13:27,"## What do you use in nilearn?
- `_utils.check_niimg`
- resampling / cropping functionality
- `NiftiMasker`
- `plotting._plot_img_with_bg` ;) (but other ones, too, of course)
- `datasets` fetchers!

## What problems?
- This is probably overfitting the Haxby2001 dataset usecase, but neither `NiftiMasker` nor `MultiNiftiMasker` are appropriate here, since `NiftiMasker` cannot set breakpoints for detrending and standardizing and `MultiNiftiMasker` needs different `niimgs` to do it. Potential solution: When slicing `niimgs` becomes possible, one could use the `MultiNiftiMasker` with slices
- `plotting.plot_img`, the ""general"" plotting function is not a functional superset of `plotting.plot_stat_map` (no background possible IIRC)
- `NiftiMasker.mask_strategy` is somehow always the wrong one for the data I want to treat ;)
- not a problem if handled correctly: nilearn should not overfit usecases or become an eclectic collection of not universally accepted tools. Right now everything is OK.

## Future?
- GLM, please! In a way that can read onset descriptor files but doesn't oblige me to use them. Minimum amount of classes involved (e.g. ideally 0 or 1, implementing a transformer type interface).
- Interactive plotting would to me be worth its number of lines in gold units. Every time I plot a stat map, I want to scroll around, but can't. This could be done with `pynax` in the slimmest possible way.

A cosmetic issue when plotting positive values only, by using `plot_stat_map` on which are displayed symmetric values. I use `plot_img` as an alternative at this time.

GLM, of course !

It the example is included in some narrative documentation it makes more sense to have one plot per figure because it makes the insertion of plots more seamless: i.e. code snippet - plot - code snippet - plot - etc ...

Actually that's a good point. Inserting the following lines would do the

You are never looking at the number of your data matrix. There is always
resampling and interpolation in visualization, unless one pixel of your
screen represents one voxel of your data matrix.

While your remark is true, I think that it is important to _always_ keep
in mind that a visualization system is not neutral to what it does to the

We _need_ to make this work. People don't want to have to resample, they
want things to 'just work'. In addition 99% of them won't know which
resampling method to use, so forcing make a choice is not solving the
problem. We can add a warning.

'nearest', the others a continuous resampling. That's exactly the reason
why we separated these function.

And, if we don't solve the problem for them, the only consequence is that
they will have some strange aliasing in their visualization.

I don't think that, for now, such a case is worth spending too much time.
We need to keep in mind that we are working with a fixed budget, and that
we need to maximize the impact of nilearn with this fixed budget. That

As said by Gaël, you can save your image into a Nifti file and visualize it with fslview. pynax (see my repos) can also be used to do that. However, it is not compatible with current plotting functions in nilearn but it shouldn't be too much work.

Interestingly enough `np.any` has a 50% overhead compared to `.any`. While we are playing with micro-optimisations, `any(arr.flat)` could be a candidate but I guess it depends how many False you have to iterate through before finding the first True or the end of the array.
