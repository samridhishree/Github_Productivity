i would like to use canICA to filter out noise by removing all components which are not related to my signal of interest (it was a visual task). 

so i want to return to my 3d+time FMRI dataset, but only use components which i will decide based on their spatial weight maps if they are contributing relevant signal. 

does anyone know how to do this? either canICA or DictLearning would be great. thanks!
