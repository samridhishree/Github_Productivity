I think the outcome was that nested classes wasn't good practice, and we found a case where pickability was broken. Good enough for me to drop it. Also adding an underscore in front of the class name, namely using _Checked4DImageIterator makes me happy enough about the whole thing.

No, it's definitely good policy. With this code it becomes much harder to
introspect or to pickle (pickle is pretty much based on reflexivity, and
this breaks reflexity)

From my understanding of Python scopes, you shouldn't be able to pickle the result of iter_img (the iterator itself) but I can be wrong.

> The main reason I put it inside the class it that otherwise iter_img and Checked4DImageIterator are an alias of each other, which doesn't seem ideal.

I have no strong feeling. I just prefer classes outside of functions for the sake of readability. I honestly didn't think of people trying to pickle iterators.

Yep you are right, I just checked pickling the `iter_img` function originally.

Modal functions are not good for API. Users tend to get them wrong.

Aside from making the code simpler, I don't see a benefit of the greedy
loading.

It's for everywhere. One example: if I need to load a resting-state data,
but discard the first 3 images.

Ah! Your remark applied to check_niimg and not to index_niimg? Then I
mostly agree with it that two modes could be useful. My remark does apply
here, as it is a developer-oriented function.

Remind me what did you mean by suboptimal? I seem to remember that you were concerned that `check_niimg` will be called on individual 3d images but that's not the case because `_index_niimgs` doesn't include checks and only does the data slicing + 3d image creation.
