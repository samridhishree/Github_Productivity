```
 if request.scopes is not None:
        token['scope'] = ' '.join(request.scopes)
```

if the client send scopes like ""scopes=read-only%20write"" in HTTP, this code make scope ""r e a d - o n l y   w r i t e""

how about this such like in used def validate_scopes () in draft25.grant_types.py 
     if request.scopes is not None:
            token['scope'] = ' '.join(utils.scope_to_list(request.scopes)) 

def validate_scopes () in draft25.grant_types.py 
        if not request.scopes:
            request.scopes = utils.scope_to_list(request.scope) or utils.scope_to_list(
                    self.request_validator.get_default_scopes(request.client_id, request))
