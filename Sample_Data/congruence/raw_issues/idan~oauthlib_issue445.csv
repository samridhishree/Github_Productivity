However, when the redirect is performed, `confirm_redirect_uri` is called with `None` as `redirect_uri`. This doesn't match the `redirect_uri` saved earlier. Is this intended behavior? It felt wrong for me to have to check for `None` myself, and repeat getting the default URI from the client datastruct again.","start issue","`confirm_redirect_uri` does not get the default redirect URI"
