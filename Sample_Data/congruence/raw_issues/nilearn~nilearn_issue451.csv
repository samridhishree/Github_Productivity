Regarding the test, a bit of explanation about matplotlib.

`from matplotlib import pyplot as plt`

If you use a plotting function like `plt.plot`, the plot will be added to the current figure that you can access with `plt.gcf()`. 

So, if I take your original code and simplify it (I didn't run this code :P), we could do:

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import nibabel
import numpy as np
from nilearn.plotting import plot_glass_brain


maps_img = nibabel.Nifti1Image(np.random,random((10, 10, 10)), np.eye(4))
fh1 = plt.figure()
fh2 = plt.figure()
ax1 = fh1.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)
# Note: pl.gcf()== fh2 because it is the last figure created.
assert(pl.gcf() == fh2)
# Since we gave ax1, the figure should be plotted in fh1.
# Before your fix it was plot in fh2.
slicer = plot_glass_brain(maps_img, axes=ax1, title='test')
# Test it
assert(slicer.axes[0].get_figure() == fh1)
```
