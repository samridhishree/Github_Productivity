I have a custom pylint checker which looks like this:

```
#!python
def process_module(self, node):
    # ...
    for (lineno, line) in enumerate(node.file_stream):
        # ...
    else:
        self.add_message('modeline-missing', line=1)
```

(full code [here](https://github.com/The-Compiler/qutebrowser/blob/d625cde28cdf40c562ebb868a146901e9a72deb9/scripts/pylint_checkers/modeline.py))

Since upgrading to from 1.2.1 to 1.3.2 (and pylint from 1.3.1 to 1.4.0) I got the error message for every file, unless I add a `node.file_stream.seek(0)` at the top.

I looked at the pylint plugins and found this in checkers/misc.py:

```
#!python
def process_module(self, module):
    # ...
    stream = module.file_stream
    stream.seek(0)  # XXX may be removed with astroid > 0.23
```

So this looks like a regression to me.

Fixed in c827e3da6e683d918a58bf0a2e7ce6d2b8b41592. We'll release astroid 1.3.3 as soon as I fix the performance issue you reported in Pylint.
