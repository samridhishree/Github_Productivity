See pip documentation for install_requires here:
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/requirements.html#install-requires-vs-requirements-files

It looks like at the least, install_requires should contain ['pyjwt', 'cryptography']

pip install oauthlib does not provide a working copy of oauthlib until the user either manually executes the requirements.txt file or manually installs pyjwt and cryptography.
