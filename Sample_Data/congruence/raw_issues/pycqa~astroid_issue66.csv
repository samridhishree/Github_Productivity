I'm using **getattr** in a base class for dynamic methods, and I'd like to be able to set that base class to ignore in TYPECHECK so that I am not bombarded with 'no-member' errors in pylint. There are a lot of classes deriving from this base class, and it's quite the pain to include every new derived class in the 'ignored-classes' part of the pylintrc. It'd be much easier if Pylint ignored sub-classes for typechecking if the base class is ignored.

Could you report this issue on Pylint's tracker https://bitbucket.org/logilab/pylint/? The general idea sounds good, but the issue belongs there. Thank you.
