"issue_comment","124","idan","oauthlib","ib-lundgren","2013-03-02 20:04:16","Good idea. Fancy having a look at OAuth 1 and see if it mentions anything regarding the structure of client keys and secrets? If not we could ""backport"" the OAuth 2 version for later use in OAuth 1 provider. If there is then we might want to move them to each respective versions specific utils module.

FYI: using sets for the test might be a good idea here, something like 

```
self.assertEqual(len(set(generated) - set(allowed)), 0)
```

OAuth 1 say nothing about how to create clients IDs, So I think we can use
the same client key creation functions used by OAuth2 for OAuth1 what do you think?
