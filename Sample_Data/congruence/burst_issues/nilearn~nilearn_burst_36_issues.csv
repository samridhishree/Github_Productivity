If they are NaNs in the data, take a mask of these, do an imputation of the data in this mask (using our imputation method that works by growing the data from the edges of the mask), resample the imputed data. In the mean-while, resample the mask and use the resampled mask to insert NaNs in the output image. This last step would be optional, to keep the imputed values in the output image.

That's why I use an interpolation order of 0: this setting handles

Indeed. I didn't feel confident to do this robustly, as it could require
extrapolating arbitrarily far from the data, and I'd rather that such an
operation be done by the user, as it is bound to be fragile.

Yes, it would be significantly more work to try to keep them, so I gave
up :). I think that right now we have a somewhat sensible behavior to
non-finite values, and I think that we can stop here. At least now we
won't be completely breaking pipelines when there are NaNs.

I am not expecting resampling by more than a factor of 4 (going from 4mm
voxels to 1mm voxels). But what this really boils down to is a trade-off
between computing speed and quality in most common cases.

It might be improvable by looking at the largest eigen value of the

This might happen, and it would be a problem if we actually tried to do
inpainting of missing values in the NaNs, but we are not doing this. We
need to extrapolate only to avoid border effects near the NaNs.
