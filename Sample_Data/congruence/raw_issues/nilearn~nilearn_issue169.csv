Hi,

I am trying to contact you because I am part of the parietal INRIA team (https://team.inria.fr/parietal) and we would like to use the ""parietal"" organization on github for our team.

I do not see any public activity on the parietal account page. I was wondering if you were using it, and if not if you would mind deleting this account for us to use.

Sorry for the intrusion, and thanks a lot,

GaÃ«l

We gave up on the ""Parietal"" name. Too bad.
