I took as example the layout and stylesheet from [scipy-lecture-notes](https://github.com/scipy-lectures/scipy-lecture-notes).
The css changeset also contains a fix for the code example overlapping the sidebar. Thus I'll close #1078.

Bonus point if you can fix the bug that's also present in scipy-lectures where the subsection don't get bold.

"issue_comment","1082","nilearn","nilearn","aabadie","2016-04-15 10:20:50","It should be ok now. Main changes:
- in the table of content sidebar section are expanded while scrolling and the text of the current section is now bold (before it was a rectangle background)
- the same logic applied to the examples : current examples section text displayed in bold
- I fixed the positioning of the TOC while scrolling
- the top navigation bar has a sticky behaviour : when on scroll it stays at the top of the window. The bottom navigation was useless so I removed it.
- I backported the css for auto wrapping python highlights from scipy-lectures-notes.

I had a look but couldn't find a solution to this problem. To me the issue comes from [here](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/doc/themes/nilearn/layout.html#L109) : the subsection are still hidden when activating their parent section, preventing the subsection to become `active` and thus `bold`.

What you describe is weird. I don't have this but only tested on Linux with Firefox : The horizontal navigation bar sticks to the top while scrolling and the right side bar as well. In the right side bar, the current section is highlighted with bold text.

I gave a try to chromium and notice that the horizontal bar doesn't take the full with of the page, this is a bug. The second problem is that something it has a jumpy effect when scrolling with the mouse wheel.

I pushed a change that should be ok now (only tested with chromium for the moment). Maybe someone can also test with Safari and Chrome using MacOS or Windows ?

Have you tried the [latest build on circle ci](https://circle-artifacts.com/gh/aabadie/nilearn/341/artifacts/0/home/ubuntu/nilearn/doc/_build/html/index.html) ?

What version of Chrome/Firefox are you using ? (I'm running Firefox 46.0 and Chromium 49.0)

I don't think so. I could trigger a spurious behaviour on Mac OS using both Firefox and Chrome which seems to be similar to what you described initially : the sidebar on the right disappears while scrolling. To me, this is a css issue. I'll try to fix it.
