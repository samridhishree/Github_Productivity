For example, astroid contains a wide variety of different misspellings for ""class.""  The preferred misspelling, according to PEP8, is ""cls.""  For other keywords/builtin names, it suggests appending a trailing underscore.  I've started using in these the new code I'm writing, but it would be nice to be consistent throughout.  Another example is how the code variously uses ""e,"" ""ex,"" ""exc,"" and probably some others for the name in the as part of an `except` clause.  I'd prefer to use ""error,"" but we should establish a consistent spelling for common variable names like this.

Regarding exceptions my preference goes to exc and it's probable already
spawned over the code so it may ne a pragmatic choice :)
