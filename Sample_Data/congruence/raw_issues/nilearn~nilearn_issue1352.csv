```Python
from nilearn import image
dwi = nibabel.load(dwi_filename)
mask_img = image.math_img(""img[..., 0] > 50"", img=dwi)
```
but my `ANTS` processing using this mask is failing with an error ""Inputs do not occupy the same physical space!"". 
When I manually generate the mask
```Python
mask_data = dwi.get_data()[..., 0] > 50
manual_mask_img = nibabel.Nifti1Image(mask_data.astype(np.int8), dwi.affine, dwi.header)
```
the same preproc works.
I am not sure of what causes the problem but seems like `math_img` does not preserve the qform.
```Python
print(np.all(manual_mask_img.header.get_qform() == dwi.header.get_qform()))
```
prints `True` while
```Python
print(np.all(mask_img.header.get_qform() == dwi.header.get_qform()))
```
prints `False`","start issue","image.math_img does not preserve qform"
