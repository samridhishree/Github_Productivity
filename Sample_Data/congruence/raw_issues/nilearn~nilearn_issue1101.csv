I am getting this error

```
>  File ""/Users/Ralf/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nilearn/plotting/displays.py"", line 659, in _show_colorbar
>     bounds = np.linspace(norm.vmin, norm.vmax, our_cmap.N)
> 
> AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'N'

```

This is my code 

```
display = plotting.plot_connectome(delta_edge, 
                         networks_coords[3:], 
                         display_mode = 'y',
                         node_color= networks_cols[3:],  
                         colorbar=True,                         
                         edge_cmap = 'Blues',
                         edge_vmin = 0,
                         edge_vmax = 0.075,
                         annotate = False,
                         );        
```

All works well without the custom edge_cmap. If that is intended behavior, all is fine, but perhaps one wants to make a note. Thanks, Ralf.

"issue_comment","1101","nilearn","nilearn","AlexandreAbraham","2016-05-22 20:39:48","You are right, we should accept colormap names. In the meantime, you can use this workaround:

``` python
from matplotlib.cm import get_cmap

display = plotting.plot_connectome(delta_edge, 
                         networks_coords[3:], 
                         display_mode = 'y',
                         node_color= networks_cols[3:],  
                         colorbar=True,                         
                         edge_cmap = get_cmap('Blues'),
                         edge_vmin = 0,
                         edge_vmax = 0.075,
                         annotate = False,
                         );
