``` python
import nibabel
import matplotlib.pyplot as pl
from nilearn import plotting, datasets
from nilearn.image import iter_img
import pylab as plt

atlas_img_4D, labels = datasets.fetch_harvard_oxford('cort-prob-2mm')
img = nibabel.load(atlas_img_4D)

n_colors= img.shape[3]
node_colors = [plt.cm.spectral(i / float(n_colors))
                                                for i in range(n_colors)]
display = plotting.plot_anat()
for i, cur_img in enumerate(iter_img(atlas_img_4D)):
    display.add_contours(cur_img, levels=[30], linewidths=2,      
                         colors = [node_colors[i][0:3]])

pl.show()
```

Output:

However, I am raising problems using a MSDL Atlas. I could not able to show contours on default MNI template in `plot_anat.py`. Any advise on how to resample each map to MNI space ?

You should not need to resample.

Could you do a pull request with the code that you have as a function in img_plotting and an example that produces the problem that you are having with the MSDL atlas.
