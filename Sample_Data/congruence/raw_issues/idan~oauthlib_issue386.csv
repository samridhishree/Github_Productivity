The current implementation of `validate_realms` / `validate_protected_resource_request` is to require that all realms in `realms` are present.  I think it would be beneficial to have an optional argument such as `realms_any` that could be used for further customization.

in other words:
current- `realms=[a, b]` requires a AND b.
future- `reams_any=[a, b]` would require a OR b.
","start issue","future suggestion - support for 'any' in realms validation."
