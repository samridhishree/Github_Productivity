It's not too apparent if `create_token_response` is a method that's supplied and implemented by the library or are we actually creating the token generator?  If not then where do we define the datastore to save the tokens?

I see we implement the RequestValidator and use our own data stores, but for the preconfigured all-in-one servers how much do we implement ourselves?

Thanks in advance for the clarification.
