1. Run pylint on Python 2 .py files that import .pyc files
2. Note the resulting traceback (shown in part below)
### Current behavior

Traceback:
...
  File ""~/.toolchains/base-bin-x86_64-debian_testing-python_2.7.12__wxpython_3.0-1.0.0.14/lib/python2.7/site-packages/astroid-1.5.0-py2.7.egg/astroid/modutils.py"", line 606, in _spec_from_modpath
    return found_spec.replace(location=location)
AttributeError: 'ModuleSpec' object has no attribute 'replace'
### Expected behavior

No traceback

I have verified that I get expected behavior when I modify line 606 to be:
    return found_spec._replace(location=location)

I made the modification to an up-to-date clone on the master branch.
### `python -c ""from astroid import __pkginfo__; print(__pkginfo__.version)""` output
