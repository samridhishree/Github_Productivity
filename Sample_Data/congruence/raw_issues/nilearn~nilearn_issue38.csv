"pull_request_commit_comment","38","nilearn","nilearn","AlexandreAbraham","2012-12-03 08:14:01","Yes, and I'm not really honest in the error message because, if high_pass > low_pass, you don't end up with a blank signal but with some weird values full of NaNs which, in my sense, is worse. That's why it's really an error and not a warning.

In fact, I've put these parameters as None by default in the butterworth function and, as they were passed as ""False"", they were considered as 0 and bugs raised.

I've changed it to None to avoid this bug in the future.
