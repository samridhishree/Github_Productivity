Returning a refresh token for this flow, however, is hard-baked into oauthlib--as far as I can tell, it is not optional...see [`resource_owner_password_credentials.py` line 108](https://github.com/idan/oauthlib/blob/master/oauthlib/oauth2/rfc6749/grant_types/resource_owner_password_credentials.py#L108).
