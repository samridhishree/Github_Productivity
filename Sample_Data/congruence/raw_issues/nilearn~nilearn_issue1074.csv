the `__init__`method of estimators found in `nilearn.decomposition`, such as `CanICA` and `DictLearning`, accepts parameters for their masker. When `fit` is called we use `check_embedded_nifti_masker`, from `input_data.masker_validation`, to create an apropriate masker. At some point this function checks that none of the masker's parameters overrides parameters passed to the estimator's `__init__`(which does not seem necessary in the case in which no mask was given to the estimator, since in this case the masker's parameters are read directly from the estimator's) and emit a warning if they do. However, this check is performed using `if(estimator_param != masker_param)` , and some of these parameters are numpy arrays, resulting in an exception being raised by the `__nonzero__` method of the result of the comparison since it has more than one element:

`ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
`
the error can be reproduced with:

```
from nilearn import datasets, decomposition
from nilearn._utils import testing

def pass_masker_params_to_estimator():
    image = testing.generate_fake_fmri()
    target_img = datasets.load_mni152_template()
    estimator = decomposition.DictLearning(target_affine=target_img.affine, 
                               target_shape=target_img.shape)
    estimator.fit(image)

pass_masker_params_to_estimator()
```

in  `check_embedded_nifti_masker` the problem arises here:

```
   # Raising warning if masker override parameters
   conflict_string = """"
   for param_key in sorted(estimator_params):
       if new_masker_params[param_key] != estimator_params[param_key]:
