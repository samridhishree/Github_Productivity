The error message doesn't tell the user how to fix the problem; it doesn't even mention *NILEARN_DATA, etc. That is, for the frontend user this error message is not very helpful..

"issue_comment","257","nilearn","nilearn","AlexandreAbraham","2014-10-10 14:44:10","Well, I did not speack explicitely of the NILEARN_DATA variable because this is not the actual problem. The problem is that you try to run a script in a directory where you don't have writing permissions. Setting a NILEAR_DATA environment variable could solve your problem (and is certainly the most recommended way) but this is not mandatory, you could also specify a data_dir manually.

So you think that, if the download fails because of an IOError, we should issue a message that looks like a usage which specifies all the rules used by nilearn to find a writable path? Ping @GaelVaroquaux

If you can find 3 lines that describes this well, this is good. Elsewhere
it is too long, and people won't read it. Just write a paragraph as well
as possible in the docs, and do a http link to it in the error message
(linking to the online version).

Basically, when you start from a fresh install, nilearn_data (or any of the other alternative paths) is not created resulting in

Something similar happens if you have defined NILEARN_DATA but $NILEARN_DATA doesn't exist.
