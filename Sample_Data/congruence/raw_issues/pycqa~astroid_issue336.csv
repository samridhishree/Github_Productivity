I am trying to add pylint/ project to Chromium project (https://codereview.chromium.org/1920403002/). However, the licensechecker of Chromium complains about some python files in astroid/ don't have proper license header, those are:

astroid/brain/builtin_inference.py
astroid/brain/py2stdlib.py
astroid/brain/py2mechanize.py
astroid/brain/py2pytest.py
astroid/brain/py2qt4.py
astroid/brain/py2gi.py
astroid/test_utils.py

Can someone update these files with license header? Thanks a lot!
