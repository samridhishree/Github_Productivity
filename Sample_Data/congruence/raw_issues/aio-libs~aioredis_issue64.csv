I'm in progress with new commands.
Implementing them should not take long but the most complicated part is the tests.
Anyway, I've created [branch](https://github.com/aio-libs/aioredis/tree/commands_3.0) where the work is being done and PRs are welcome.

We would love to see this in aioredis. @popravich do you consider merging the fork from @trezorg? If so - we could help out with writing some tests for the redis cluster abstraction.

Currently, I have merged ~130 of 230 commits, including the switch to PyTest, so I guess most of the work is done. However, since the PR branch works quite well at my organization, I'm afraid that this merge has not the highest priority right now.","",""
