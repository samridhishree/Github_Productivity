"issue_comment","301","idan","oauthlib","JonnyFunFun","2015-02-27 14:19:50","I encountered the same issue, as well as in `prepare_refresh_token_request`:

Around line 300:

```
body = self._client.prepare_refresh_body(body=body,
                refresh_token=refresh_token, scope=self.scope, **kwargs)
```

However there is no `_client` attribute.  I submitted a pull request with the change in #324 but it appears that all tests fail after this, so I'm not sure what to do with it.
