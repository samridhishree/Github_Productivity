"issue_title","130","idan","oauthlib","johanmeiring","2013-04-02 11:21:41","The documentation at https://oauthlib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/validator.html indicates that the ""scope"" item of the token dict that is sent to the save_bearer_token() function should be a list.  However, line 190-191 of tokens.py (inside the create_token() function of BearerToken class) sets the ""scope"" item as follows:

``` python
if request.scopes is not None:
    token['scope'] = ' '.join(request.scopes)
```

... thus setting it as a space-separated string instead of a list.

So, in other words, should it be a list or a space-separated string?  Should the documentation change, or should the create_token() function be altered?  Or, am I just being crazy and missing something?
