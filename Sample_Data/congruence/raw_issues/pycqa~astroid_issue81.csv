Discussion of https://bitbucket.org/logilab/pylint/issue/32/e1101-false-positives-for-exception suggests that the most straightforward solution to that bug might be an astroid brain plugin to add correct knowledge of the attributes of Python's built-in exceptions (such as `.args`, `.message`, etc.).

But I managed to fix it through a special object model, which did the job quite nicely. Unfortunately, this is going to be released in 2.0, so it's going to take a while before going in the wild.
