Not necessary vmin and vmax could already be passed through the kwargs. This PR is mostly documenting this fact.

`A lower/bigger bound filter that pushes any map value up/down smaller/bigger than vmin/max towards vmin/vmax.`

mention the analogy to np.clip()?

""Given an interval, values outside the interval are clipped to
the interval edges.  For example, if an interval of `[0, 1]`
is specified, values smaller than 0 become 0, and values larger
than 1 become 1.""

Analogy to np.clip is probably not usable for our non-advanced users. The advanced one should understand vmin, vmax as it is standard.
