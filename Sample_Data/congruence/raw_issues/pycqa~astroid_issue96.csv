We can do more in astroid.raw_building. There are some cases where we can retrieve the arguments supported by those members, either by using inspect.getargspec / inspect.Signature or by parsing the help() output. Here's one place where we can do better, for instance: https://bitbucket.org/logilab/astroid/src/83053ac2227e483004445d34247e3ccc35527ef1/astroid/raw_building.py?at=default#cl-167

In the modular-locals bookmark, functions in raw_building now use inspect.Signature to introspect functions.  I haven't tried to parse help() output, mainly because it would be far too difficult.

Should be sufficient for now. I was thinking that we can retrieve the signature of builtins by parsing their help output, but as you said, that's too difficult and can be handled with a more saner approach by using stub files.
