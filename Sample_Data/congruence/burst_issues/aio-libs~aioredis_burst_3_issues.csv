4,issue_comment,24,aio-libs,aioredis,popravich,2014-07-06 19:35:41,"Looks good but I think that methods' arguments should have better validation, for instance `lindex(key, index)` method has check for `key` arg but no checks for `index` arg.
",,
5,issue_comment,24,aio-libs,aioredis,jettify,2014-07-06 20:21:00,"I thought the main reason to check `key` against `None` is that _redis_ replies with somewhat not obvious error response:

```
>>> redis.lindex(None, -1)
ERR Protocol error: invalid bulk length
```

but in case wrong  `index` argument, we get more clear message: 

```
>>>redis.lindex(key, b'one')):
ERR value is not an integer or out of range
```

note: that  ``redis.lindex(key, b'-10')` is valid command, and maybe it is not necessary to check that `index` is integer.

---

Anyway, I'll add more validation to arguments.

6,issue_comment,24,aio-libs,aioredis,popravich,2014-07-07 06:35:29,"My intention of these mixins is to provide a bit simplier and at the same time more strict interface.
For those who wish to use `b'-10'` there is always `.connection.execute` method which allows to do anything.

9,pull_request_commit_comment,24,aio-libs,aioredis,popravich,2014-07-08 06:59:42,"Tests for blocking list operations doesn't work as expected:
Creating a task in lines above only schedules it for execution
and then yielding from `lpush` will first send a value to list then will give control to loop
 which will start the `waiter` task.
So the code above would work the same ways as if it was written like following:

``` python
yield from self.redis.lpush(key1, value1)
yield from self.redis.blpop(key1)
