"issue_title","73","idan","oauthlib","ib-lundgren","2012-11-16 19:09:51","Investigate whether it would be useful to add PyPy and Jython support and what would be necessary for it to happen. As far as the OAuthLib code goes neither should be an issue but that might not be the case for the dependencies. 

The biggest concern is likely to be PyCrypto. 

I vaguely remember seeing threads about issues with that combination but not sure about the current status. 

Jython could be tricky, there might be wrappers or suitable alternatives but needs some research.

  congratulations :)

I think we could add `pypy` to `tox.ini` and `.travis.yml` files.  (`.travis.yml` seems not to contain even 2.6, 3.2 and 3.3.)

@dahlia Cool to know that pypy seem to work tho, feel free to send a PR adding it to tox.ini =)

Travis is currently setup to run tox which tests 2.6, 2.7, 3.2 and 3.3, which is not obvious since the travis yaml file only mentions 2.7.
