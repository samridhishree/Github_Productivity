Setting up a new development computer with python 3.5 i stumpled upon the following error:

Using this trivial working valid python code file, name it dummy.py:

```
#!python

print(""test"")
```

testing it with `pylint dummy.py` causes this traceback:

astroid and pylint don't support Python 3.5 yet, I'm still working on this and it will be due soon, in a couple of weeks. In the mean time, you can test with the repository versions, but be aware that they aren't very stable.

Ok, i'll give the repo versions a test. 

Would't it be useful to show a more prominent warning that as of now astroid isn't working with python 3.5? Because that's how i was trapped. No warning while installation via pip, no warning or information on the site - the only trace is issue #117

+1 for this, just got bit by this myself.

Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) will be shipping python 3.5 as the default python interpreter, so it would be great to get this fixed & packaged in Ubuntu at some point before April 2016.

We're working on releasing 1.4.0 with support for Python 3.5. The branch is here https://bitbucket.org/logilab/astroid/commits/branch/1.4.0, we're grafting non-controversial changes from the default branch until we're reaching a point where the branch is good to go for a release. It would be definitely sooner than April 2016, my expectation is that by the next week, we'll have it released.
