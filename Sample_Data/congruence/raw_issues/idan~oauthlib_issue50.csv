However this issue should stay open until the JWT token RFC is finalized.

I do not know any Django providers that use it.

"issue_comment","50","idan","oauthlib","clintonb","2016-04-19 21:10:43","There seems to be some confusion. I'm reading here that folks believe a _server_ has been implemented. I only see a client: [ServiceApplicationClient](https://github.com/idan/oauthlib/blob/master/oauthlib/oauth2/rfc6749/clients/service_application.py). If a server has indeed been implemented, would someone point me to it?

"issue_comment","50","idan","oauthlib","duaneking","2017-11-13 16:47:14","I am deeply interested in making sure that JWT/RFC7519 support is added and would like to do whatever is needed to make sure this is added as *soon as possible* as it doesn't seem to be working.

This is my current personal and professional critical path.

1. How can I best help to make sure this is supported?
2. How can I best contribute?
3. If I did the work and made sure all the tests passed, is that all that is needed for the PR to be accepted?
4. I noticed other pending changes that deal with JWT's that are not jet merged in; are they missing something I need to be aware of to get my own PR in?

I didn't see a ""contributors guide"" checked into the source; so asking here as my current need is highly targeted to JWT and the docs all say to track this here.

"issue_comment","50","idan","oauthlib","duaneking","2017-11-13 20:21:01","It looks based on initial research that JWT support may simply be all about the implementation of RequestValidator used, as well as the injection of 2 methods for token creation.

If not, is that at least the current goal of the oauthlib architecture?","",""
