It's worth noting that parameter order in the two functions is opposite: `_fetch_file(url, data_dir, ...)` vs. `_fetch_files(data_dir, files, ...)`. An additional change here could be to flip the parameters of one (I think `_fetch_files(files, data_dir, ...)` would be the way to go.

2. +1 for the switching. I can also do it if you want.
