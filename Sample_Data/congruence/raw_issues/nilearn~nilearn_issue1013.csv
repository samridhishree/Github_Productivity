Typically, the FD is padded back (ie a value 0 is added at the back) and thresholded and 1 tr is removed before, and 2 after (a total of 4 frames).

@pbellec has some matlab code that implements this and should be converted to python and nilearn:

To build the sample mask:

To compute FD:

The reference paper, on scrubbing from which all the formulas come, is:

For example, to compute the FD: https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/blob/7965125125319d895464f40db57b0eaba9c84da3/CPAC/generate_motion_statistics/generate_motion_statistics.py
