"issue_title","434","nilearn","nilearn","bcipolli","2015-02-17 02:25:21","On the nilearn homepage, it says nilearn is part of the nipy ecosystem.  However, there seems to be a lot of conceptual overlap between nilearn and nipy, and I'm confused about the intended interaction / organization of the two packages.

For example, how do the nilearn masking tools relate to [nipy's masking tools](http://nipy.org/nipy/stable/labs/mask.html)?  How to interop the `algorithms.statistics` tools in nipy with those here?  And when implementing new code, how to understand what should be a pull request here vs. over at nipy?

Some clarification in the docs about how these issues would be really helpful to a newbie like me, and perhaps people who are familiar with nipy and new to nilearn as well.

The interaction with most packages in the nipy ecosystem is clear enough for me (one question about including `clean` here vs. in `nitime`).  The intended interaction with the nipy package itself is the one that's most unclear to me.  Thanks!
