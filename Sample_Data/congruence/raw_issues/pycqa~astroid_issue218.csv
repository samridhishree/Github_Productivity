With scandir now in the 3.5 stdlib and some progress on PyPy compatibility (there's a pull request at https://github.com/benhoyt/scandir/pull/53), it might be worth revisiting the use of scandir in modutils, if necessary in a conditional way.

Sounds good! scandir is also backported to Python 2, why is it necessary to be used in a conditional way?

Because it's now in the stdlib, we have to use the same pattern as for singledispatch.  If PyPy compatibility is broken too,

``` python
try:
    from os import scandir, walk
except ImportError:
    if platform.python_implementation = 'Cpython':
         from scandir import scandir, walk
    else:
         from os import walk
```

Or something like that.
