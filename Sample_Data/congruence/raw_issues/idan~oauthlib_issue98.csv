"issue_comment","98","idan","oauthlib","ib-lundgren","2013-02-03 16:52:47","This requirements file was added when Idan experimented with pycco but have not seen much love since. I believe users of oauthlib are better of installing with pip install oauthlib as there are no dependencies for normal use. The few people using RSA as a signature method can use pip install oauthlib[rsa].

That said, a dev specific requirements.txt could be useful. Please also add nose and mock (#99) then I'll merge =)
