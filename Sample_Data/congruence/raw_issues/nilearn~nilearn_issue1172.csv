You are right, but I was planning to add even more examples ! demoing the impact of radius choice of spheric ROIs and the frequencies bandwidth. Because I think that the connectivity preprocessing in the examples are somehow ""basic"" from some users point of view, and I wanted to show that more elaborate things can easily be done with nilearn.
