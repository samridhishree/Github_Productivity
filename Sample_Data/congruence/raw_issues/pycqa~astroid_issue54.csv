With astroid 1.2.1 available from pypi, running pylint of some projects of my company work just fine but using changeset:   1273:4b36c6903a05 fails with:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""/Users/gilles/devel/lib-ocs/venv/bin/pylint"", line 9, in <module>
    load_entry_point('pylint==1.3.1', 'console_scripts', 'pylint')()

    if isinstance(arg, Tuple):
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
```

This seems reproducible on a couple of projects with a big enough code base.

I wrote a patch that works around the problem by creating a cache in `infer_stmts` but it makes unittests fail and I am not sure if this is the way to go at all.

Do you have a small snippet that reproduces this problem?

I looked up some publicly available project that shows the problem and found that flask-sqlalchemy has it:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy.git
$ virtualenv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
$ pip install --process-dependency-links -e .
$ pip install pylint
$ pip uninstall astroid
$ pip install <path_to_astroid_clone>
$ pylint flask_sqlalchemy
```

I can't reproduce this with astroid & pylint HEAD as of right now, using flask_sqlalchemy.

It seems like the instructions for reproduction were incomplete. I was able to reproduce the crash with

```
#!python
import sqlalchemy
sqlalchemy.Table()
```

This is now fixed in https://bitbucket.org/logilab/astroid/commits/14ecf7228d27267773598a625e440a1de060e3dd

@torstenmarek can you comment as to which version the fix is in? I'm seeing a similar error when using astroid 1.3.2 and pylint 1.4.0.

Could you paste the traceback? Maybe it's some other error.

Closing until a reproducing case can be given. Notice that the latest astroid has some fixes regarding the same problem with other libraries, maybe they are related.
