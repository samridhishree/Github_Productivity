``` python
from nilearn.datasets import fetch_adhd
from nilearn.input_data import MultiNiftiMasker

masker = MultiNiftiMasker(memory=""nilearn_cache"", verbose=10)

data = fetch_adhd(n_subjects=10)
func = data.func

masker.fit(func)
data = masker.transform(func)
data = masker.transform(func)  # Cache is used


data = masker.fit(func)
data = masker.transform(func) # Cache is recomputed !
```

What happens is that mask_img is considered a different argument in `filter_and_mask` after two different `fit`. I don't know how to fix this, as I believe it is a joblib argument hashing issue.
