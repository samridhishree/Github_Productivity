At the end of the day, this PR has nothing to do with Windows or the tests so I don't think we should be too worried about an AppVeyor failure.

I just did it, it's queued and now I hope it won't be cancelled.

This looks acceptable as a temporary solution, adding a more self-explanatory comment would be good though.
