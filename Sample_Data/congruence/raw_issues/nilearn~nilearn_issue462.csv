from nilearn import datasets
from nilearn.image import iter_img, index_img

haxby_dataset = datasets.fetch_haxby_simple()
func_img_1 = index_img(haxby_dataset.func, 0)
print list(iter_img([func_img_1]))
```

**Expected:**
a list of one image.

**Current Behavior:**
The image is duplicated.
`[<nibabel.nifti1.Nifti1Image object at 0x10bcf4f90>, <nibabel.nifti1.Nifti1Image object at 0x10bcf4f90>]`

**Notes:**
I believe this problem may be deeper rooted (and more severe than just this example).  I found this while debugging `check_niimgs`, which I believe has a bug with how it deals with iterators.  But I don't have time to dig deeper into this.
