This is not the case for the second one. We should be using the second in our examples.

The drawback is that, that we would need to switch the default of fetch_haxby from n_subjects=1 to n_subjects=2, which will entail more download, and thus a heavier load during group tutorial. I think that it is worth it.

That's a good idea. Deprecating n_subjects, and replacing it by an
argument 'subjects' that would take a list, and would be '(2, )' by
default.

I am +1 on such proposal.
