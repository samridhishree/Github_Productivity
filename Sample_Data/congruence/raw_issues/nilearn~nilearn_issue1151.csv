Currently, if I want to use them in one of my wrapper scripts I have the following hack:

```
from nilearn.plotting import cm

cmap = 'cold_white_hot'

if hasattr(cm, cmap):
    cmap = getatt(cm, cmap)
```

Would it be possible to have these colormaps already loaded so they're available by name without this code?
