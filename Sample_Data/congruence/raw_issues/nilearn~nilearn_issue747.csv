I just bumped into the fact that we have already _utils.short_repr which is actually not very useful because it truncates at 18 characters ... See for example this snippet

``` python
from nilearn import _utils

_utils.load_niimg(['/this/is/a/very/long/name/for/a/nifti/file'])
```

The not so great error message you get:

```
TypeError: Data given cannot be loaded because it is not compatible with nibabel format:
[/this/is/a/very/l...
```

Addition by Alex. Steps to solve it:
- [ ] Turn the two `repr_niimg` functions into a single one with `short=True` kwarg.
- [ ] Find a nice way to display the niimgs
- [ ] Replace all occurencees of `_repr_niimgs[:200]` by the shortened version (maybe the long if verboser is high?).
