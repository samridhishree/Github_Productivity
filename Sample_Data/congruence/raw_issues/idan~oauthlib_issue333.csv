I'm sure there are a bunch of able hands out there and several of these are probably waiting in the PR queue already. Lets try and get through this together, I will merge any PR that has 1 or more ""Looks good to me"" comments on it. Please ping this bug when a PR has been reviewed and I'll make sure I take a look within the next working day :)

When the bug queue has been cleared I'll add write access to people who are interested.

#338 is trivial and should be accepted,
#339 includes a test and LGTM

I think one thing we should look at doing soon is a new PyPI release (#346). Anyone fancy writing up a change list? I'll push once we have one. 

As always, if you have a question, would like to discuss something or simply draw my attention somewhere feel free email/hangouts msg me at ib.lundgren@gmail.com. 

p.s. If you would like to become a contributor please get in touch. In this round I included people from this thread but there are many more who have made great contributions in the past. If you are one of those please do not be offended but rather sent me an email :)
