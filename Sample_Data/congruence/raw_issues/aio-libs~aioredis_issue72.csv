Thanks for PR.
I know about this problem for a while but had no time to fix it properly.
Regarding the fix, it should be a bit more complex:
you solved the problem of stucking `_pool.put` call but not the problem of creating and closing multiple connections to Redis.
The better way to fix it is to use some locking mechanism to prevent `_pool` queue overflow.

For now, I'll close this PR.
