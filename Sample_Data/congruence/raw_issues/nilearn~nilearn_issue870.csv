- Run this script:

``` python
from nilearn.plotting import plot_stat_map
import numpy as np
import nibabel
import pylab as pl


a = nibabel.Nifti1Image(np.zeros((10, 10, 10)), np.eye(4))
plot_stat_map(a)
pl.savefig('test.pdf')
```
- Open `test.pdf` using Inkscape.
- Save it as `test_.pdf`
- Open `test_.pdf` in evince: the background appears black.

way to reproduce it using inkscape not to print one sheet of paper
everytime we want to test a solution.

I'm a bit helpless :-/ on this one.
