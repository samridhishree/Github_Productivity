NodeNG's `__repr__` includes a call to `self.root().name`, which will fail on an AST fragment whose root doesn't have a name attribute.  This is mostly an inconvenience when trying to debug the process of building ASTs.

Could you give me an example where the root doesn't have a name attribute? I presume this is the case for nodes for which their root is not a Module, which is wrong, .root() should always return a Module.

I first encountered this problem in debugging astroid, which may well have involved an incorrectly-generated AST.  However, I'm more thinking about Macropy and similar code generation applications which can involve splicing pieces of an AST into another AST or building an AST from the bottom up rather than the top down.

Right, it makes sense for an AST not to have Module as root. Care to work on a patch?

I will work on a patch once I'm finished with the node constructor patch.

No problem. I'll do more reviews for your PR next week, since I'm pretty full with EuroPython right now.
