a) One strange thing in plot_rest_spectral:
The special masker is supposed to extract only the left hemisphere, yet only the right hemisphere is depicted in the plots - error in HemisphereMasker or in the plotting function?

b) Also the clustering does not appear to work perfect in the upper example yet.

It is well suited to cases where the data are characterized by their similarity (i.e. locally) rather than some global coordinates. To be pedantic, this is good at clustering data sampled on manifolds.
