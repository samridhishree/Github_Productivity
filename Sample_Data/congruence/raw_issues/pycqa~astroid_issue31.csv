If my source has:

```
#!python

MULTILINE_VARIABLE = [
    'foo',
    'bar',
    'baz'
]
```

I would expect tolineno to indicate the line containing the solitary ']' character. Instead, it indicates the line containing 'baz'. If I insert blank lines, a la:

```
#!python

MULTILINE_VARIABLE = [
    'foo',
    'bar',
    'baz'





]
```

I see the same behavior -- the 'baz' line is still the .tolineno.

IIRC this has to do with the underlying python parser which returns erroneous line information. I think Torsten did take a look at this and that his conclusion was that we should use 2to3's parser which does'nt suffer from this problem. But I'll let him confirm that.
