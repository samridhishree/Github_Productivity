Few issues found already:
- `cv_scores_` shape was wrongly documented
- `alpha_grids_` doc missing
- `best_model_params_` doc missing and format list(list()) to be changed to ndarray
- `alpha_` is no longer an attribute
- `all_coef_ , classes_ , coef_img_ , mask_ , memory_ , n_classes_ , w_ , ymean_ , Xmean_ , Xstd_` attributes are missing

Additionally, it is perhaps not sufficiently clear whether and how specifying a list to `l1_ratios` performs hyperparameter tuning. The practical question could be what the difference is to running `SpaceNet*` wrapped by sklearn's GridSearchCV.
