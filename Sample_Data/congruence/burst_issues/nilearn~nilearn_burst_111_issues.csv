As such, I commonly need to show statistical maps centered both on the site of stimulation and on the projection areas (commonly the larger cluster).

Since it is one and the same map, and it makes no sense to change the color mapping between the two views, I would like to make the plots share the colorbar. Is there any way of doing so?

There are few things need to be done before merge.

- ```threshold=threshold``` is missed specifying in ```_plot_img_with_bg```. By specifying that, user can now pass their threshold to rois, if needed.
- In the ```plot_roi``` docstring at parameter ```threshold```. You should add ```default=0.5```.
- Add a Notes section above See Also. In Notes, adding a single line saying that ""A very small threshold is applied by default to eliminate numerical noise from the images background. Otherwise, images will be plotted with background noise.""

In case of a 4D image, ndimage is going to take the large CC in all
direction, ie in the 4D space. That is most likely going to surprise the
user. I think that, if the input image is 4D, we want to either raise an

For me (being more of a user): In my feeling no added functionality is needed as iter_image & concat_img should do the job already. But maybe adding an explicit example could do the trick, to stress the usefulness of those function (also new_img_like etc.). However: different issue. ",,

https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/nilearn/regions/region_extractor.py#L401
so the default value `smoothing_fwhm=6.` of function `connected_regions` is systematically applied and this is not suitable for my mice images (voxel size is 0.2x0.2x0.2)

Another point is that `min_region_size` is assumed to be an `int` and in my case it may be lower than 1.

@KamalakerDadi may be I was unclear. So first my mouse fMRI images have different range than human images, e.g.` print func_imgs[0].header.get_zooms()` gives `(0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 1.0)`. Now I am using DictionaryLearning to extract my networks, with a smoothing FWHM suitable for my data
```Python
from nilearn.decomposition import DictLearning

dict_learn = DictLearning(n_components=20, smoothing_fwhm=.3, n_jobs=-3)
dict_learn.fit(func_imgs)
components_img = dict_learn.masker_.inverse_transform(dict_learn.components_)
```
At this point everything works fine. Now I want to keep only large enough regions
```Python
extractor = RegionExtractor(components_img, thresholding_strategy='ratio_n_voxels',
    extractor='local_regions', min_region_size=.4)
extractor.fit()
```
and here I have an error
```Python
ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation maximum which has no identity
```

However when I set `smoothing_fwhm=.3` here
```Python
https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/nilearn/regions/region_extractor.py#L401
```
I get my regions extracted.",,
