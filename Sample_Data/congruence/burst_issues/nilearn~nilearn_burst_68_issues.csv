We probably want to flip it when the slice is in the left part of the brain in plotting and make two sagittal plots (one left hemisphere and one right hemisphere) in the glass brain.

14,issue_comment,798,nilearn,nilearn,lesteve,2015-10-21 12:24:29,"First of all, there is a problem that `nilearn.EXPAND_PATH_WILDCARDS` and `nilearn._utils.niimg_conversions.EXPAND_PATH_WILDCARDS` are two different variables, so setting one has no effect on the other. As an illustration:

``` python
from nilearn._utils import niimg_conversions
niimg_conversions.check_niimg('this_file_does_not_exist')  # error with please set global constants EXPAND_PATH_WILDCARDS to False

import nilearn
nilearn.EXPAND_PATH_WILDCARDS = False
niimg_conversions.check_niimg('this_file_does_not_exist')  # still the same error as previously
```

Also I am a bit confused about EXPAND_PATH_WILDCARDS functionality. Why don't we want to always use `EXPAND_PATH_WILDCARDS = True` ? 

Is it because we worry about files which contains the following characters: `*`, `[` or `?` ?

Good point I missed that. Looking at your tests a little bit more I think we should be testing 3d data too.

If you only have test.nii which is a 3d image in the current working directory, you expect.

``` python
 # 3d image
check_niimg('test.nii')
 # 4d image with last dimension 1 i.e. it is equivalent to check_niimg(['test.nii'])
check_niimg('test*.nii')

I was pleased (and surprised) to see that nilearn offers some apparently quite nice plotting functions (at least for human data). I am wondering:
- Why does it make sense to package these plotting functions together with functions better described by ni_learn_? Would it not be more intuitive (and perhaps make the plotting function modules more readily recognisable as such)  to package them as ""niplot"" or something of the sort?
- Is there any (more-or-less) easy way to plot some rodent data with the functions currently offered by nilearn?

Glass Brain was made by hand. Take a look at

nilearn/nilearn/plotting/glass_brain_files/*.svg

You will see that there are three vector drawings. If you can create these
for the main gyri/sulci of the mouse brain, you can have a mouse glass
brain.

So it depends on how much effort you want to put into it.

This has been discussed and the code is not mature enough to be separated from the core.

You can customize the background image used for regular plotting functions. For `plot_glass_brain`, the background template can be customized but it is not trivial for the moment.

What do you need exactly ?

But we don't use older versions of Python. This is why this seems strange to me.

If _cut_coords_ is a scalar (as in your example), then it's expected to be
and integer representing the number of cuts you want. We can't do the
coercing automatically, as this would run into conflicts with the rest of
the logic. The error you're getting is because the 0 you passed for
_cut_coords_ is being interpreted as number of slices (_n_cuts_ in your
traceback), leading to a zero-division. The latter tells us there is a
stealth bug in the _find_cuts_ function: it should sanitize the value
_n_cuts_ param and throw a meaningful error in case invalid (for example,
in case it's _0_).

I changed it but it still creates a new image because it uses new_img_like() from nilearn.image.image

Is this fine? In this case, instead of 
`new_img_like(img, img.get_data().copy(), img.get_affine().copy(),  copy_header=True)`
it just makes a deep copy
`img = copy.deepcopy(img)`

A couple of tips:
- double underscore does emphasis (aka bold) in markdown so you want to use backquotes to escape them, see this [link](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for more details.
- using Fix #number in a PR description does automatically close the issue #number once the PR is merged
