However, on one a super computers and on a brandnew local
cluster (64GB RAM) we experienced ""MemoryError"" problems.
Disturbingly, this bug does not appears to be systematically
reproducible. Sometimes the script (which is only analysing 40 nifti
images as input) works fine, sometimes we get a memory error - a
behavior we experienced on both super computer and cluster.

On the cluster, lunching the Python script single-threaded (n_jobs=1)
the process appears to occupy ~19GB of RAM (which is counter-intuitive
given only 40 niftis as input), ~22GB when n_jobs=2 and throws almost
always an exception when n_jobs=3 (after the first two threads lunched
successfully as it appears).

Here is a link to the python script plus data:

We actually circumvented the memory overload problem (that occurred on
Jülich supercomputer and local cluster) by using a different nifti
template, which constitutes the search space for the searchlight analysis.
This works fine now, but does unfortunately not allow to tell where the
initial problem was coming from. I still suspect the masker...

See you in 2 weeks!,

Sorry for the short answer yesterday, it was very late so I've been brief.

The first thing I've spotted is that you do:

```
from nilearn.utils import *
```

which means that you don't have the latest version of nilearn installed. This shouldn't be an issue but this would be the first thing to try. Then you could try to run it on several computers with different configs. On my side, I usually have the latest version of packages.

You can also run this command:

```
pip freeze
```

to get the list of all your modules and their versions. Please post it there if upgrading nilearn is not enough. On which system are you running ?

The best thing to do, I think, is to use the memory profiler which has a feature to raise an error when a certain amount of memory is used. Do you think that it is possible to run it on the cluster ? Were you able to reproduce the bug on a classical desktop computer ?

That sounds ensuring. Might it be a platform-specific things or depend on
the version of python code used inside the searchlight?

Best,
Danilo

I tried on a super computer (Jülich super computing centre) as well as on a
new (local) high performance cluster. Same problem on both.

Thanks for your advice, I will go ahead with these...

redownloading/-installing anyways?

The snapshot shows the +30GB RAM usage per process as measured by htop.

have no account. The last status was that the NiftiMasker probably caused
the excessive memory load, as fitting another mask image circumvented the
bug.
