I am worried that the default setting look pretty bad. Could you replace
the colormap by an alpha one, to see how things look like. We would need
things to be good by default, and right now it is not the case. My
suggestion would be to use a transparent colorbar starting fully
transparant at the threshold, and becoming fully non transparent at the
max value.

It doesn't suit our purposes. You should probably add an extra argument
to the colormap-generating function to control the lower value for alpha,
and set it to 0 in the case of the glass-brain.

I think it does, there are a few very negative values in the eyes that survive the max along an axis.

> The second thing is that on the black bg, we should probably have a colormap going to black (which tells us that the argument that we take should maybe be a color, not a colormap, and we would generate the corresponding colormap.

We could have the cmap default to None and then do the logic in plot_glass_brain to switch between the white and black background. The white background would have a colormap going from white to red and the black one a colormap going from black to red.

> I think that we should apply it on the raw maps, and then project, as this is what a user would want to do when visualizing a statistical map: do not display any voxel that has too small a statistic.

I believe that's what we are doing at the moment. That would explain why you see some white pixels (e.g. top left or bottom left) with the threshold=10 which are not here with the default threshold. The threshold removes small positive values and you are left with the more extreme negative ones. 

One last comment, the data is actually contrast data, I am wondering whether it would be worth calculating p-values like this [example](http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/plot_localizer_simple_analysis.html#example-plot-localizer-simple-analysis-py) to have a more realistic use case.

I went back on forth on this one, that's what I did naively at first but I got convinced by @bthirion to only take the max (something related to the fact that you can easily transformation t-tests into F-test and that the latter only has only positive values). Also as a side comment, note we are not summing but taking the max along an axis.

> These are T maps? If they are T maps, that's a pretty good example of standard usecase.

I think we are using the contrasts via `datasets.get_localizer_contrasts`. I hadn't seen until now that you could get t_maps by setting `get_tmaps=True` in this function. I'll try that.

This is a kludge that is only used to be able to get the alpha to percolate from img_plotting.plot_glass_brain to brain_glass.plot_brain_schematics. Eventually they get passed to the matplotlib patches of the brain schematics.

To be honest I am not sure we need alpha. The plots do look better with alpha=0.7 (which has been used for the most recent snapshots) but maybe we can achieve a similar effect by just tweaking the color of the lines in the svg.

I would agree using only functions glass_brain.py is simpler. Having the glass brain plotting as part of the Axes makes sense but you need to jump through a few more levels (the `**kwargs` I added to a few methods [recently](https://github.com/lesteve/nilearn/commit/9909e211752197a844a18dd26043eb6792b8a5e0)). Other than that, there are still coord (axes level) and cut_coords (display level) in a few places in slicers.py which is a bit awkward given that it doesn't really apply to the glass brain use case.

> Next step is to add smoke tests, so that the test coverage is as high as possible (we aim for 90% or more).

Yep I started doing that but I bumped into errors I don't really understand yet.

I would say: add a base class, and inherit from it in the OrthoSlicer,
where you add methods, and in your own projector, where you add different
methods.

But it's not a method. An object is more than a namespace of methods. It
has an internal state and methods act on its internal state. That's why
reading code that is object-oriented is harder to read: you never know
what has changed and what has not.

Thus, I would really push for using functions rather than staticmethods.

Eventually they get passed to the matplotlib patches of the brain schematics.

To be honest I am not sure we need alpha. The plots do look better with alpha=0.7 (which has been used for the most recent snapshots) but maybe we can achieve a similar effect by just tweaking the color of the lines in the svg.
