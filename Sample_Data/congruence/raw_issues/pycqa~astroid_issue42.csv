Since upgrading to astroid 1.2.0 pylint has been failing with an exception.  Minimal test case:

```
#!python

from nose.tools import raises

@raises(RuntimeError)
def test():
    pass
```

Run with `pylint test.py` gives traceback:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):

    load_entry_point('pylint==1.3.0', 'console_scripts', 'pylint')()

  File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/astroid/scoped_nodes.py"", line 670, in is_method
    return self.type != 'function' and isinstance(self.parent.frame(), Class)
  File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/logilab/common/decorators.py"", line 155, in __get__
    val = self.wrapped(inst)
  File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/astroid/scoped_nodes.py"", line 536, in _function_type
    _type = _infer_decorator_callchain(node)
  File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/astroid/scoped_nodes.py"", line 501, in _infer_decorator_callchain
    result = current.infer_call_result(current.parent).next()
StopIteration
```

This test case works fine with astroid 1.1.0.

Will be fixed. We'll wait for a week or two for more of these regressions to occur before releasing a bug fix version.
