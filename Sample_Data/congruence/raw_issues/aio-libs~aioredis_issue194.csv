I think this is a bit confusing.

TODO:
* [ ] allow `await redis.set(..., exist='nx')  # case-insensitive`
* [x] keep current constants: `await redis.set(..., exist=redis.SET_IF_EXIST)`
* [ ] update docs adding parameters description","start issue","update `set(.., exist=)` command to accept `nx`/`xx` parameter values"
