0,issue_title,226,idan,oauthlib,TkTech,2013-12-09 20:10:01,"About two years ago it appears pycrypto was swapped out for python-rsa. Then at some point about a year ago pycrypto was re-introduced (this time as a soft dependency).

My questions:
- Why was this decision made?
- If python-rsa was no longer viable, why not the alternatives like tlslite?
- Why is there no easy extension mechanism for swapping out implementations?

I ask because [jira-python](http://jira-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) already includes [tlslite](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tlslite) which is perfectly capable of doing the signing, but is pure-python and can optionally use pycrypto for acceleration. Howerver, there is no easy (or maybe there is but undocumented?) way of swapping it out without forking the code. I had to resort to monkey patching to do so:

``` python
def _pure_python_rsa_sha1(base_string, rsa_private_key):
    """"""
    An alternative, pure-python RSA-SHA1 signing method, using
    the tlslite library.
    """"""
    import base64
    from tlslite.utils import keyfactory

    private_key = keyfactory.parsePrivateKey(rsa_private_key)
    signature = private_key.hashAndSign(base_string.encode('ascii'))

    # This *must* be unicode, since oauthlib refuses to work with
    # anything else.
    return unicode(base64.b64encode(signature))

# Monkey patch the built-in RSA-SHA1 signing method, since the
# package offers no proper extension mechanism.
from oauthlib.oauth1.rfc5849 import signature
signature.sign_rsa_sha1 = _pure_python_rsa_sha1
```

2,issue_comment,226,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2013-12-09 22:28:49,"If I recall correctly we quickly swapped to python-rsa to ease installation of oauthlib. However, since pycrypto was (at the time at least) considered more proven in the field we preferred pycrypto. Instead of relying on an arguably less trusted library we decided that it is better to let only the ones who really need to use OAuth1 with RSA go through the installation process, hence the optional dependency and swap back again.

I remember searching for alternatives at the time but did not stumble upon tlslite, since then there has been no search or suggestion to use alternatives which is why there is no easy way to swap which library is used. It would be a very neat feature to have and I'd love a PR :)

I've not really thought about how to best implement this but maybe trying to either do library detection through imports or asking the user to explicitly specify would be viable options.
",,
3,issue_comment,226,idan,oauthlib,TkTech,2013-12-10 00:17:31,"Because the signing methods are so simple, I was thinking of:
- making the `Client()`'s `signature_method` kwarg accept a method instead of a string.
- `oauthlib.oauth1.SIGNATURE_RSA` then just becomes an alias for the default implementation.
- `SIGNATURE_RSA` uses tlslite by default, which is widely portable with 9 years of development and can use M2Crypto, pycrypto, or GMPY if they are installed for speed.
- Add tlslite to `setup.py` as it's a light dependency (simplifying installation of oauthlib with all features out of the box).

I think this would be more future-friendly and lower maintenance than library probing (although they aren't incompatible).

I'll go ahead and make these changes in a PR if you are okay with them.
",,
4,issue_comment,226,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2013-12-10 11:30:02,"Sounds good. I'd say make signature_method be either a string or a method and use error catching to decide, something along the lines of 

```
try:
    signature_method(...)
except TypeError:
    proceed as before...
```

and keep tlslite optional. The number of people using OAuth 1 is decreasing since most providers are moving away from it and the subset using the RSA signing method has always been a very small minority (AFAIK).

Looking forward to the PR :)

Raise an `AttributeError` from `common.Request.__getattr__` so that `getattr` can be used like normal on a request. This commit breaks a lot of existing tests, which I'll fix in another commit.

This might break backwards compatibility if people are relying on `getattr(Request)` automatically returning `None`.

One solution would be to replace all of the assumptions that a request attribute will be either something or `None`, or another would be to provide default values in `Request._params` in the constructor.

Some password are revealed through the request body in debug logs.
Could you please take a look to this issue?

In the module oauthlib.oauth2.rfc6749.grant_types.resource_owner_password_credentials **request** objects are dumped into the debug log.
example lines 98, 99

``` python
            log.debug('Validating access token request, %r.', request)
                self.validate_token_request(request)
```

As a consequence the file contains the entire request (including the body of the request)

```
[DEBUG] oauthlib.oauth2.rfc6749.grant_types.resource_owner_password_credentials: Validating access token request
...
body=""username=foo&password=bar&grant_type=password&client_id=test""
```

This issue potentially affects all OAuth2 flows (not only the password flow)

You can test this issue with the following curl request 

``` bash
curl -v -X POST -d ""grant_type=password&client_id=test&username=foo&password=bar"" ""http://localhost:8000/o/token/""
```

- Django 1.8 
- django-oauth-toolkit

In many cases the debug logs are enabled on prod and pre-prod. 
Even worse, in many cases logs are sent directly to a SIEM through syslogd and readable by a group of people.
Now imagine if the windows or unix pam write a log with your password.
Only poorly implemented products needs to debug the password.
Anyway, this must be documented!

After looking at how other projects do this, most will either hide sensitive log information by default (e.g. Apache2), or will remove known sensitive strings such as passwords (e.g. Dovecot).
