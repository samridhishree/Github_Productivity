- The scripts generally need z_slice for the plotting function and k_slice, e.g. to figure out the number of detections in the slice. I didn't know better than to use coord_transform. I am wondering whether there is a better way to do this.
- For long titles, using plot_stat_map with a title argument is not going to work out. In theses cases, I had to hand-tweak the figure size and use `display.title` with a carefully chosen y > 1. Better suggestions more than welcome!
- In plot_haxby_mass_univariate.py I had to give up on the ImageGrid and have two separate plots. plot_stat_map colorbar is quite off when specifying an axes parameter.

# plot_haxby_multiclass

This one seems reasonable: the cv scores go up from 0.2 to 0.7

# plot_haxby_grid_search

This one I am not sure the cv profiles change quite a bit, especially the Left-out validation scores that start quite high up in the 0.7 before going back to 0.5 when k grows.

I'm a bit worried about x axis flipping: could you make sure to keep the 'L' 'R'  annotations on the images ?

Are you saying they are hidden by the title from time to time? Maybe they don't show for some other reason.
