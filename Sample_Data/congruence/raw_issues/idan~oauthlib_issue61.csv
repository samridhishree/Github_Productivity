"issue_comment","61","idan","oauthlib","ib-lundgren","2012-10-03 14:22:07","Thanks for pushing towards OAuth 2 Server support! 

We now have 3 versions spread out with @sontek starting on some (#58), my local one which is close to complete authorization grant code and implicit grant code support and this one. This is my fault since after doing the initial work way back this summer I wanted to reorganize it a bit and broke all the tests, which is the state it has remained in since, and because of this I never pushed it.

I will try and get around to cleaning it up and merging it in here this week and if I can't find time for that I'll just push the slightly messy code I have now and whoever feel like it can tear it apart in search for useful bits.

idea for what I've been meaning to do but never found time to.
