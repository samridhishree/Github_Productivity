Given this code, A.getattr('**mro**') doesn't actually return the mro, but the ancestors
as returned by Class.ancestors(). This should call Class.mro() instead.

```
#!python

from astroid.test_utils import extract_node
n = extract_node('''
class A:
   pass
''')
print(n.getattr('__mro__'))
```

Class.getattr('**mro**') returns the actual MRO.

Also, Class.getattr('**bases**') returns actual bases.
It previously didn't work correctly, because it was putting the
entire ancestors into the Tuple object and it put those classes
into the wrong attribute.
Closes issue #128.
