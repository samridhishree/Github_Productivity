There's a new version of [pytest](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest) available.
You are currently using **3.0.5**. I have updated it to **3.0.6**

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.0.6.dev0

>=======================

>* pytest no longer generates ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` from its own operations, which was introduced by mistake in version ``3.0.5`` (`2118`_).
>  Thanks to `nicoddemus`_ for the report and `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR.



>* pytest no longer recognizes coroutine functions as yield tests (`2129`_).
>  Thanks to `malinoff`_ for the PR.

>* Plugins loaded by the ``PYTEST_PLUGINS`` environment variable are now automatically
>  considered for assertion rewriting (`2185`_).
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Improve error message when pytest.warns fails (`2150`_). The type(s) of the
>  expected warnings and the list of caught warnings is added to the
>  error message. Thanks `lesteve`_ for the PR.

>* Fix ``pytester`` internal plugin to work correctly with latest versions of
>  ``zope.interface`` (`1989`_). Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Assert statements of the ``pytester`` plugin again benefit from assertion rewriting (`1920`_).
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Specifying tests with colons like ``test_foo.py::test_bar`` for tests in
>  subdirectories with ini configuration files now uses the correct ini file
>  (`2148`_).  Thanks `pelme`_.

>* Fail ``testdir.runpytest().assert_outcomes()`` explicitly if the pytest
>  terminal output it relies on is missing. Thanks to `eli-b`_ for the PR.
