"issue_comment","203","idan","oauthlib","kdazzle","2013-08-03 19:20:19","@ib-lundgren Hmm, I think you might be right about moving them into /docs. The code already has the list of methods and shows that they give NotImplementedErrors, so that documentation might be redundant where it is now. 

However, being able to find all things RequestValidator in one place is kind of nice.
