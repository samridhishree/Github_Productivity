Actually do we want to make sure the examples run with the minimum matplotlib advertised version, namely 1.1.1? Off the top of my head 1.1.1 is the version in Ubuntu 12.04 so you shouldn't have the problems you mentioned.

Side-comment: the conda env should have libpng installed so the problem you are describing is a bit surprising. Having said that from time to time conda does miss some dependency (like the libgfortran case that we saw for numpy some time ago) so it could well be the case here as well.

It does in your branch. I am guessing you (or I in my original experimental branch) took it from one of the distrib in .travis.yml. Basically 1.3.1 is completely arbitrary.

You can find a numpy version compatible with matplotlib 1.1.1 inside conda. Just play locally with conda and you'll find one. I tried a few days ago and I am pretty sure numpy 1.6 worked.

Also, before doing that and now that it works, have you looked whether the running time of the examples has decreased, since that the prime motivation of this issue.

We have no guarantee since we do not host the data. But `figshare` has an excellent API for managing datasets so I think that we should take advantage of it. The code to download COBRE (ie downloading the json and then each file individually) can be easily adapted to any other dataset hosted on figshare.

An option could be to rely on the big file if individual download fails but the nilearn code is not ready for it.

I am not sure: our goal is to make examples simple. To load CSVs, we
should really point users to pandas (we need to add notes about this here

The problem is that it's not the point of view of matplotolib.

I took a quick look at your problem. It comes from the fact that you create subplots by hand, which is not supported by nilearn. By doing this, you break the automatic behavior of matplotlib on which nilearn rely.

For example,  if you do this:
`figure, (axes1, axes2) = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(10,5))`

You obtain something more reasonable althought the text still overlaps with the figure.

Solving this problem is not trivial unfortunately. The best way is maybe to do 2 separate figures.

OK. I agree that it is very difficult to support.

Maybe we should deprecate this feature. I know that some people won't be
happy, but it is a road to unexpected behavior.

It requires to call proper matplotlib methods to get information on the display instead of relying on the magical ability of matplotlib to find a good size for the plots.

Note that if you plot each line in a separate plot, the result is very ugly although there is no overlap of figures.

I think that I should explicit what happens in matplotlib and how this problem can be solved. When you plot something, before any call to `pyplot.show()`, matplotlib is unaware of the size of the plots. When you show (or save them), matplotlib will do the maths and adapt the size of the figure to the content, trying to avoid overlaps, with more or less success. When using subplots, a default size is given to the figure, I don't know exactly how it works, but the magic is gone. In that case, if some behavior relied on the magic instead of plotting things carefully by defining the boundaries of each axis, things are messed up.

People from matplotlib solved this kink of layout problems by introducing the GridSpec layout. It allows to create a grid of plots easily, get the correct sizes and set constraints on them. We did not use that in nilearn because, historically, we supported matplotlib 0.99 and this has been introduced in matplotlib 1.0.

Indeed, and we are overriding this behavior in nilearn by registering a
specific formatter. It's tricky: most people don't understand this code.
But it's the code that makes the plots look nice by default.

We could make this formatter aware of the colorbar. That might be the
right way to do it. It requires someone who can understand the matplotlib
formatters to pick this up. That's the rare resource.

As a side note, it would be interesting to dig up the PR where @bcipolli
had worked on this. It might be that the solution is in it.

15,issue_comment,857,nilearn,nilearn,bcipolli,2015-11-26 14:48:04,"@salma1601 can you post a code snippet to reproduce the problem? 

As far as code I've done for plotting, I'm not sure any would fix this:
- I messed with the colorbar in #464 (merged).
- I played around with subplots in #212, code here: https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/compare/master...bcipolli:issue-212
- I messed with the label colors (described [here](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/449#issuecomment-75629299)) in this branch https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/compare/master...bcipolli:issue-449

I doubt that any of these branches will solve the problem, but I'd be happy to try (if I can get a code snippet to reproduce the issue). I can also debug it if nothing here solves it.

When we talked before, subplotting was considered to be advanced behavior. The default behavior actually works fine, using the reproducing script: 

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4072455/11426426/3b122164-942a-11e5-8ad2-71ceaef2750d.png)

Simply setting the image size to compensate for the size of the plots also works (as detailed above):

``` python
figure, (axes1, axes2) = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(18, 5))
```

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4072455/11426708/e8fda266-942b-11e5-9228-7e0e5c7db499.png)

And reducing the # of cuts allows cuts to be larger:

``` python
    plotting.plot_img(haxby_anat_filename, axes=axes,
                      colorbar=True, display_mode='z', cut_coords=4)
```

So, the default behavior works, and there are lots of ways to set things up for more advanced users that work just fine. IMHO, there's not much need to address this via a matplotlib formatter.

That's nasty! It means that the data cannot be time-filtered. We
absolutely need to warn people clearly about this in the description of
the data, as they will overlook this fact, and apply eg time filtering.

That would be awesome. We could easily have a switch in the downloader
that would download one or the other. We could also demonstrate in an

22,issue_comment,915,nilearn,nilearn,pbellec,2016-02-10 09:30:48,"OK so this turned out to be [much more work](https://github.com/SIMEXP/niak/issues/122) than I had expected, as it forced me to separate the generation of confounds from their actual regression in the niak preprocessing pipeline. But hopefully this will help make the outputs much more re-usable so it's all good. Here is my proposition. 

There will be a file `<subject>_<session>_<run>_n.nii.gz` per subject. The _n suffix is for ""spatially normalized"", a la SPM. Actual processing steps will include: 
1.  Slice timing correction.
2.  Motion estimation (within- and between-run for each label).
3.  Linear and non-linear spatial normalization of the anatomical image.
4.  Coregistration of the anatomical volume with the target volume of 
5.  Concatenation of the T2-to-T1 and T1-to-stereotaxic-nl
6.  Resampling of the functional data in the stereotaxic space.

No regression of confounds, no smoothing. For each dataset, there will be a file `<subject>_<session>_<run>_confounds.tsv.gz`. It is a compressed file of tabulation-separated-values. See an example [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3fQhLcXWtDRb084YmczQ1lrRDA/view?usp=sharing). Each column is a confound, and the first row is a label. 

The labels will be explained in a separate json file, called [niak_confounds.json](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3fQhLcXWtDRNXpfeThTN3Q2eEE/view?usp=sharing). Note that some labels may be used multiple times: there are several covariates for slow time drift for example. I didn't want to include the frequency in the labels, because I did not want the labels to change from one dataset to the other. 

Hopefully, with that type of preprocessed data it will be easy to try alternative regression paths / smoothing directly from nilearn. Please let me know what you think.

a huge one.

However, I think that we should move on. The figshare interface makes it
hard to write code that does partial downloads. Figshare is also clearly
bandwidth limited: the download speed is limited on their side. What I
have in mind is that, in a latter PR, we will create a mirror of the data
on Nitrc, which has a fast download and makes it easier to organize
partial downloads.

There is one little thing, which is that the example runs for 10mn. We'd like to make this faster, as 10mn is quite a dent in our budget with regards to compute time for all the examples. I am playing a bit with the various estimators locally to see if I can make things faster.

Looking at the behavior on circle ci, to me the problem is more due to the refresh rate. The default behaviour (update the line each time a block 8192 bytes is downloaded) is too fast and circle CI cannot handle correctly the '\r'. There are other places where writing to `sys.stderr` is used and the problem doesn't happen because the time between 2 displays is long enough for circle ci output to handle the '\r' correctly.
Renaming `report_frequency` with `report_updates` would probably better reflect what this option actually does. Maybe we can use a higher fixed value (something like 100) and remove all CIRCLECI related code.

This argument should have a doc anyway. But since we use a heuristic to autocomplete the input, we can decide which behavior we want.

I remember playing with this a while ago and I vaguely remember that it wasn't that simple to reuse our colorbar code. From my notes:

the colorbar stuff is done in add_overlay
so that passing cmap=edge_cmap and colorbar=True in plot_glass_brain
doesn't do anything ...

Something I hacked together in img_plotting.py (not even sure that was working TBH)

``` python
    display = plot_glass_brain(None,
                               display_mode=display_mode,
                               figure=figure, axes=axes, title=title,
                               annotate=annotate,
                               black_bg=black_bg)

    class PseudoImage(object):
        def __init__(self, norm, cmap):
            self.norm = norm
            self.cmap = cmap

    from matplotlib import colors
    norm = colors.Normalize(vmin=-1, vmax=1)
    display._colorbar_show(PseudoImage(norm, edge_cmap), None)

    display.add_graph(adjacency_matrix, node_coords,
                      node_color=node_color, node_size=node_size,
                      edge_cmap=edge_cmap, edge_threshold=edge_threshold,
                      edge_kwargs=edge_kwargs, node_kwargs=node_kwargs)

```

Also I am not sure whether we want to make the colorbar depend on the values of the adjacency matrix.

CircleCI has much more horse power, both in terms of storage and length

This is irrelevant, I believe: the estimate is based only on the past
runs.

I think that the best way to compute correlations with LedoitWolf is to standardize the time series first. The reasoning being that LedoitWolf strives to give the best estimate (minimize a risk) of the covariance matrix. If what we want are correlations, we want the best estimate of the covariance of the standardized data.

By the way, such a difference will be also present with something like a GraphLasso for the estimator.

Hence, I would add in the ConnectivityMeasure transformer a test that normalizes time-series before running the covariance estimator if kind==""correlations"".

Yes I do, I also already have a branch that adds it to the maskers.

Actually, the issue already exists #203 and some code to fix it also already exists #278. The problem is that if we enable it, we have to propagate everywhere. Meaning `compute_multi_epi_mask` should use it, `CanICA` should use it, etc.

I have another suggestion (not for your PR, in general). In nilearn, we often use weird coding patterns (I'm thinking of taking the sum of a numpy array to know if there is nan inside for example). It would be interesting to keep a performance test (time and memory usage) for some of these patterns.

It is useful for other developers and, for example, we could bench the Nifti1Image format, on which we rely heavily, and thus spot if there is performance regression.

Benching the I/O is also interesting for cluster computation: some design patterns may not be favorable on a cluster because of longer file access time.

This is not a trivial work. What do you think?

For computation time testing, it's difficult because it depends on the speed of the cpu running the test. Using reference measures computed from the current master and stored in a dedicated file, we could compare the measures of a PR against them and raise an error in case of a too large difference.

I see the point. I don't how one can check the underlying I/O system calls from Python.
Maybe this could be done using a call to an external command like (only available on posix):

``` bash
# Return the number of system calls to read
strace python -c ""some python code with I/O"" 2>&1 | grep read | wc -l
# Return the number of system calls to write
strace python -c ""some python code with I/O"" 2>&1 | grep write | wc -l
```

The output of the commands above could then be sent back to and analyzed be the global python test script.

> This is not a trivial work.

scikit-learn tried to do these kind of performance monitoring at one point during a GSoC. From what I have heard, a significant amount of time was invested with little return because this is a lot of work to maintain the infrastructure to do it. From what I remember it was based on vbench which ended up changing its internals and breaking the work that was done on scikit-learn.

I should work on my impression of converging then :-). Given the %memit behaviour we saw, I would feel a lot more confident to check that the memory usage is not smaller than 10 MiB. You may need to change your test to make sure that the function uses some memory for example by creating the array inside the function if you want to make sure that something doesn't make any copy, e.g. in your test_iter_niimg stuff but that sounds fine to me.

Here is my version of the fix. I didn't tested it extensively but, on the toy script below, it works. The code is super ugly because of the need to switch between seed representation (triplet) and coord_transform one (3 lists of coordinates).

I'm convinced that a better to do it exists but I am too tired to figure it out.

Test script:

``` python
from nilearn.input_data import NiftiSpheresMasker
import numpy as np
import nibabel


data = np.random.random((3, 3, 3))
mask = np.zeros((3, 3, 3))
mask[1, 1, 1] = 1
affine = np.eye(4) * 1.2
seed = (1.4, 1.4, 1.4)

masker = NiftiSpheresMasker([seed], radius=0.1,
                            mask_img=nibabel.Nifti1Image(mask, affine))
masker.fit_transform(nibabel.Nifti1Image(data, affine))
```

I do it. However, a masked seed is not a showstopper for me: the rest of the sphere can contain unmasked voxels.

The tests actually seem to run fine with the output:

```
Ran 387 tests in 228.284s
 OK (SKIP=1)

I have seen that happening from time to time, but it tends to go away if you kick off another AppVeyor build.

Already splitted atlases should not be splitted again. The atlas you plot is actually not modified in our but the list of labels is modified even when it should not be. The code for that is quite horrible, I will rewrite it.

That's doable. But it was not clear enough to me in the issue discussion.

Yup. I am hazarding a wild guess, it may be the case that there is some code to leave some additional space for the colorbar that is not inherited in the plot_connectome case.

The `im` argument in _colorbar_show is expected to be some kind of image object as produced by plt.imshow (matplotlib.image.AxesImage), hence the name. At least this is what happening in the rest of the code. Suddenly you are passing some kind of axis object which is very surprising. ""How can that even work"" is how I felt until I realised that the .cmap and .norm attributes were set on the GlassBrainAxes instance just for the sole purpose of making _colorbar_show work.

By definition, the classes defined here with suffix ""Axes"" are supposed to be classes compatible with matplotlib Axes in order to be able to feed them to functions that are supposed to process Axes... So, in my sense, this hack makes sense in that context.

How are you suggesting that it should be implemented? A list of path
separated by colons (':'), as with other path variables? I am ok with
this, but it should be well documented. Adding features is not useful if

We would need a tiny example demoing it.

Maybe you can do a new example in the plotting section that demos plot connectome and replace the image in https://circle-artifacts.com/gh/nilearn/nilearn/1495/artifacts/0/home/ubuntu/nilearn/doc/_build/html/plotting/index.html#different-plotting-functions by the image it generates (and link to that example).

I think that, for now, we could use a hard-coded set of coordinates and connectivity matrix, for instance inspired by: https://circle-artifacts.com/gh/nilearn/nilearn/1495/artifacts/0/home/ubuntu/nilearn/doc/_build/html/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_adhd_spheres.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-03-connectivity-plot-adhd-spheres-py

> If during a tutorial a user just types this function with no arguments, we want to download only 30 subjects, as it's enough for most things.

What is puzzling me here is: Is nilearn a tool made for tutorials or for studies? People that wants to actually study this dataset may be puzzled by this behavior.

I would be in favor of creating a `fetch_tutorial_adhd` for this special purpose. Because, if space is the only issue, I suggest to restrain the study to the lighter subjects. Here are some stats:

| --- | --- | --- |
| Full ADHD | 20/20 | 1791.88 |
| 30 first subjects of ADHD | 15/15 | 1305.22 |

But the datasets are only for tutorials / demos. And beside, it's just
like the fetch_haxby, which only downloads 1 subject by default.

How about we keep it simple and don't over engineer things. It's just a
question of changing a default, from n_subjects=None to n_subjects=30.

We've already checked that all the examples work well with only 30
subjects, so we can just stick to the simple solution.

It's not an implementation detail: it's about whether it will download
something or not. Therefore is conditions disk space and the need for
internet access.

Not entirely convinced the user cares that much about these details, he just wants to get the data and  vast majority of cases has the resources (internet + disk space) to do so.

For the record that was meant as a tongue in cheek comment. IIRC most datasets in nilearn need to be downloaded the first time. The poor modern neuroscience hacker without an internet connection is slightly out of luck I am afraid, unless of course he has downloaded the dataset already.

Other than that I reckon we are getting a bit side-tracked with respect to the original issue.

Regarding fetch vs load: I am not against the distinction between online/offline but what bothers me is that this comes before the fact that the dataset is an atlas. First, I think that the difference between `fetch` and `load` is not clear for everybody (let's ask Baptiste if he knows the difference...). A better option would be to put in the name but further. Something like `fetch_atlas_blabla_offline`.

1. White space around the figure:
   I looked into this but didn't find a solution yet. In the volumetric plotting code, I figure this is the step to adapt the bounds: https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/nilearn/plotting/displays.py#L92-L94 ? 
   But since I don't use imshow here I don't see how to translate it directly. I tried to change the bounding box of the 3d axis with ax.set_clip_box but it didn't help. Maybe one of you has an idea that they could point me to?
2. Example / documentation: 
   I would like to replace the example which plots an arbitrary volume of a time series with one that plots seed-based connectivity of the example dataset. I will look into this asap and then also write a proper documentation of the example.

22,issue_comment,1016,nilearn,nilearn,KamalakerDadi,2017-02-16 09:22:10,"Two failures with respect to version dependency nibabel 1.1.0. ```freesurfer``` module is not implemented in nibabel 1.1.0 and also class ```gifti.GiftiDataArray``` has no argument ```intent```. Hence tests failed with nibabel version dependency 1.1.0.

I am not sure of another failure ```Key Error: <type 'int'>``` when writing empty dictionary to gifti file. Can you please have a look ?

May be we could do something like this to fix the tests:
```python
if LooseVersion(nibabel.__version__) == LooseVersion('1.1.0'):
    # Old nibabel cannot use freesurfer module to load the surf atlases
    # Therefore, we
    raise SkipTest
```
We need to add as a ""Note"" in documentation of atlas fetchers as well as in plotting examples about minimum version requirement of nibabel. This could be as a warning for users particularly who use nibabel==1.1.0. Do you agree ?

I agree that the data that is used now not a great example, because it isn't a stat map either, but just some random volume of a time series. So maybe I should look into creating an example map from the nki dataset? Or would it be an option to just use some map from Neurovault for now?

Well, we cannot rely on people having FS installed, so we would need to
provide downloaders, and for this we would need to check that there
exists URLs where we can download them.

## Notes

The 'Destrieux' cortical atlas is based on a parcellation scheme
that first divided the cortex into gyral and sulcal regions,
the limit between both being given by the curvature value of the surface.
A gyrus only includes the cortex visible on the pial view,
the hidden cortex (banks of sulci) are marked sulcus.
The result is a complete labeling of cortical sulci and gyri.

If you look at how Harvard-Oxford is used (for instance in the following example:
http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_signal_extraction.html ) we need the 'labels' field of the data bunch to be an array of labels.

Hence, I suggest putting in this field of the bunch, the ""labels"" field of the current structure, and a adding two other fields; one ""regions_coords"" that would be the current ""labels[['x', 'y', 'z']].tolist()"", and one ""network_name"" that would contain the ""networks"" field of the CSV.

As a results, the code should look much more similar for Harvard-Oxford and for MSDL.
