To me, this is semantically wrong--if I start with 3D, I should finish with 3D.

The practical problem I hit was while using `nipy`'s plotting functions.  They require 3D data, and this kind of unexpected 4D image made it hard to write generic code there--all other images I was working on were 3D (including others via nilearn functions like `index_img`), but only this one was not.

Here's a script to reproduce the issue.

``` python
import nibabel
from nilearn import datasets
from nilearn.image import index_img
from nilearn.input_data import NiftiMasker

haxby_dataset = datasets.fetch_haxby()
mask_filename = haxby_dataset.mask_vt[0]
func_filename = haxby_dataset.func[0]

nifti_masker = NiftiMasker(mask_img=mask_filename, standardize=True)
fmri_img = index_img(nibabel.load(func_filename), 0)  # 3D image
nifti_masker.fit(fmri_img)
print nifti_masker.mask_img_.shape  # 3D mask

fmri_masked = nifti_masker.transform(fmri_img)
fmri_unmasked = nifti_masker.inverse_transform(fmri_masked)
print fmri_img.shape, fmri_unmasked.shape  # 3D start image, 4D end image
```

"issue_comment","460","nilearn","nilearn","bcipolli","2015-02-24 10:48:58","I debugged this for a while, and the introduction of the 4th dimenions occurs in `check_niimgs`, which converts a 3D image to 4D (even when `allow_3D=True`).  Once that's done, there's no way to return a 1D vector from `transform`, and so `inverse_transform` also must return 4D.

Not sure if there is any simple fix.

"issue_comment","460","nilearn","nilearn","GaelVaroquaux","2015-02-24 15:06:31","Well, the problem is that there is intrinsically a loss of information:
the output of transform must be 2D to obey scikit-learn's convention.
Thus a 3D (n_x, n_y, n_z) image and a 4D (n_x, n_y, n_z, 1) image are
cast to the same 'X' matrix. For one of these two, 
inverse_transform(transform()) will fail to give the same shape as the
original.

We are open to changing the current convention, ie to always cast to 4D,
if you give us good arguments.
