I think having docs for how to keep using PyCrypto would be a good start for sure. Also, this update should make it easier for Windows users to get started using RSA-SHA1 as PyCrypto is fairly cumbersome to install there from what I gather.

Sorry for taking so long to reply. Would you like some help with something in particular or happy to tackle both implementation and docs?
