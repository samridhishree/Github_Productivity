The less 'imports' we need to teach to a beginner, the easier it is.

That said, we need to document (in docstrings and narrative docs) that it
is exactly matplotlib.show.

I think so too. Sorry, I said it orally yesterday, but orally is not
good.

https://circle-artifacts.com/gh/nilearn/nilearn/188/artifacts/0/home/ubuntu/nilearn/doc/_build/html/manipulating_visualizing/plotting.html

In addition, you want to phrase the problem the other way around: first
introduce 'show', and then say it's matplotlib's show:

I'll rephrase it directly in master (sudo make me a sandwich version of
commenting on a PR :$)
