I reorganized nisl to have a scikit-learn like project tree in order to benefit of all scikit learn automated tools (sphinx, nosetests...). The decoding_example.py has been put in the root so that people can run examples without having to compile or install anything.
This is still a work-in-progress but it is now stable and viewable. I made this PR so that you can comment from now on.

As in scikit-learn, python files starting vy plot* in the exemples

documentation purpose.
