I get very different time series when I set resampling_target = ""labels"" vs  resampling_target = ""data"".  Why does this happen?

from nilearn.input_data import NiftiLabelsMasker
masker = NiftiLabelsMasker(labels_img=atlas_filename, standardize=""true"",
                         verbose=5, resampling_target = ""labels"")
    
masker = NiftiLabelsMasker(labels_img=atlas_filename, standardize=""true"",
                           verbose=5, resampling_target = ""data"")

time_series = masker.fit_transform(fmri_filenames)

I believe I get correct results only when I set resampling_target = ""labels"", but this takes longer time.
Is it due to following warning ? -

I am using the most recent version of nilearn downloaded from github. Thanks.","start issue","Resampling error? - The behaviour of affine_transform with a one-dimensional array supplied for the matrix parameter has changed in scipy 0.18.0."
