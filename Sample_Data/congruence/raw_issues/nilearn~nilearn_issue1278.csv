I am a bit bothered that circleCI doesn't run due to docs.scipy.org timing out. It seems that before a release, or before merging this PR, we'd like to check that all the examples run well.

I've been restarting CircleCI in the hope that it completes. But it might
be a lost cause given that I cannot get access to it at all on my
browser.

It's not as nice, because it's not a clean, controled environment. But we
might have to do that.

OK, I'm running it on drago.

I am merging: it completed on drago without problems.

Don't release, I'll try doing it after some manual QAing.

I have absolutely no idea given that we did use this code for OHBM tutorial... I would like to fix this ASAP and not look at the root of the problem.

This should do:

``` python
from nilearn.datasets import fetch_abide_pcp
a = fetch_abide_pcp(derivatives=['rois_cc200'], SITE_ID=[b'NYU'], n_subjects=1)
```

> Will fixing in master be enough for the tutorial, or will you need a release?

I will do a release.
