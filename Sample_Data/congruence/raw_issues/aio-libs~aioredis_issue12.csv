Problem becomes even more dramatic in case of `RedisPool` ex:

``` python
with (yield from pool) as conn:
    conn.select(other_db)
# connection released and points to `other_db`; not reusable.
```

In case of pool -- connection can be closed and dropped;
in case of `.execute` -- TBD (the only solution yet is to hard-code check for 'select' command)
