guessed we'd want to expose stuff by default, otherwise we'd make them

There is no 'policy', I am afraid. It's more a question of 'design'. The
way I think of it is that nilearn needs to be as accessible as possible
(my visit to Oxford convinced me even more of this) and for this we need
to expose only high-level functionnality that is understandable and
useable to end users doing neuroimaging.
