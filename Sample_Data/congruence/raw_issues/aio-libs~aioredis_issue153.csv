>   (`pip install -e`) (`1934`_).
>   Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.
> - Fix pkg_resources import error in Jython projects (`1853`).
>   Thanks `raquel-ucl`_ for the PR.
> - Got rid of `AttributeError: &#39;Module&#39; object has no attribute &#39;_obj&#39;` exception
>   in Python 3 (`1944`_).
>   Thanks `axil`_ for the PR.
> - Explain a bad scope value passed to `fixture` declarations or
>   a `MetaFunc.parametrize()` call. Thanks `tgoodlet`_ for the PR.
