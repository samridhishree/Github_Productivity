I found that with my own data but also running the nilearn example
http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_inverse_covariance_connectome.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-03-connectivity-plot-inverse-covariance-connectome-py

I get 
In [111]: estimator.precision_.max()
Out[111]: 2.0537018448578808

In [112]: estimator.precision_.min()
Out[112]: -1.0522529001195888

I get this just using the above example with the estimator as in the example http://nilearn.github.io/_downloads/plot_inverse_covariance_connectome.py
estimator = GraphLassoCV()

@grjd Maybe you're bothered by sign flipping of coefficients ? ","",""

* The diagonal of the precision represents partial variance. They have no reason to be equal.

I find confusing that the diagonal elements have very different values, if the variables are gaussian the precision represents the partial correlations, then, the diagonal elements should have all maximum precision.","",""

Precisions are not normalized, unlike partial correlations. So yes, it's
not surprising.

What do you meean?

> i should have maximum values for the diagonal, normalized or not.

And what do you mean here?
