This reported duplicated from another project, https://github.com/landscapeio/prospector/issues/73#issuecomment-65918116

Reporter claims to have a fairly large project size. Is it possible there is a file descriptor leak?

```

Indeed, it was a file descriptor leak. Not a leak per se, since the files were closed after Pylint finished analyzing the modules, but since there were already too many open files, it failed to reach that point. In 468534927b4cace0232e6659892942b291996998 I added a new way for retrieving a module's file stream, using a method, which will be used in Pylint 1.4.1 and thus the file will be closed right away. This problem should go away by then. Since the astroid part is finished, I'll close the issue, but you can reopen it if it reoccurs in Pylint 1.4.1.
