1) either, warn the end user that the data may be placed wherever as long as a environment variable NILEARN_DATA is created containing a pointer to that directory;

2) or, upon absence of the environment variable, create it from within the procedure (warning could still be issued if needed)

Warning the user seems like a good idea to me. Another option would be to store data in a fixed path like `~/.nilearn`. I think that this is the behavior of most softwares. The problem is that it may not be obvious for people who are not into computer science, if they want to go and see directly the content of the dataset. The other problem is that it a bit user-friendly on Linux, but we would end up with a folder in the AppData folder on windows and I think that most of users does not even know that it exists.

@GaelVaroquaux Any thoughts on this one ? Sorry to highlight you everywhere but I'm cleaning nilearn issues list.
