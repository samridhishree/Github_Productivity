Other minor fixes went in while I was at it, amongs these:
- use dataset consistently for the object return by fetch_*
- use from nilearn.datasets import fetch_... to avoid dataset (the object returned by the fetcher) being confused with datasets (the module)
- pep8 fixes here and there

Comments more than welcome!

Quick comments:
- you know my position on file paths, I won't repeat it here ;)
- for subjective changes like that, bring the subject during a coffee break. Because if the PR was rejected, you would have lost time for nothing.

Makes sense, funny you should say that because this PR actually originated from a coffee break discussion. I probably wasn't clear enough about actually starting to work on it.

IDK why I commented directly in the commit this time, I probably misclicked, but it is very common in big PR (otherwise the separation in commits is worthless).
