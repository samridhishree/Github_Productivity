``` python
X, y, mask_img = _load_mixed_gambles(map(nibabel.load, data.zmaps))
```

A simple fix would be to useuse a list comprehension.

``` python
X, y, mask_img = _load_mixed_gambles([nibabel.load(fname) for fname in data.zmaps])
```

Maybe there is one of the check_niimg_ helper we can use too, not sure.
