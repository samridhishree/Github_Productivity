There's a new version of [pytest](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest) available.
You are currently using **3.0.3**. I have updated it to **3.0.4**

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.0.4.dev0

>==========

>*

>* Import errors when collecting test modules now display the full traceback (`1976`_).
>  Thanks `cwitty`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Fix confusing command-line help message for custom options with two or more ``metavar`` properties (`2004`_).
>  Thanks `okulynyak`_ and `davehunt`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* When loading plugins, import errors which contain non-ascii messages are now properly handled in Python 2 (`1998`_).
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Fixed cyclic reference when ``pytest.raises`` is used in context-manager form (`1965`_). Also as a
>  result of this fix, ``sys.exc_info()`` is left empty in both context-manager and function call usages.
>  Previously, ``sys.exc_info`` would contain the exception caught by the context manager,
>  even when the expected exception occurred.
>  Thanks `MSeifert04`_ for the report and the PR.

>* Fixed false-positives warnings from assertion rewrite hook for modules that were rewritten but
>  were later marked explicitly by ``pytest.register_assert_rewrite``
>  or implicitly as a plugin (`2005`_).
>  Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Report teardown output on test failure (`442`_).
>  Thanks `matclab`_ or the PR.

>* Fix teardown error message in generated xUnit XML.
>  Thanks `gdyuldin`_ or the PR.

>* Properly handle exceptions in ``multiprocessing`` tasks (`1984`_).
>  Thanks `adborden`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Clean up unittest TestCase objects after tests are complete (`1649`_).
>  Thanks `d_b_w`_ for the report and PR.
