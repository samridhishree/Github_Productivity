"issue_comment","50","aio-libs","aioredis","popravich","2014-10-06 07:38:20","Hi Alexander,

Do you really need that tests run agains Redis 2.6?
Why don't you consider upgrading your Redis to newer version?
Redis 2.8.x has many improvements and new usefull features, its a stable version
and besides 3.0 is comming.

Regarding PR:
Currently Travis CI is configured to use latest 2.8 Redis version so your changes still runs on newer Redis and not on 2.6 (on CI, I mean). Also this changes only related to tests so it doesn't make much ""profit"" in library itself supporting old version of server.

If you take a look at code coverage you'll notice that there still several places not been tests-covered (in particular `ServerCommandsMixin`) so I would have been much happier with PR providing tests.

By trivial reason: I have few of them and it still the only stable version on Gentoo. Yea, not a solid argument while other distros have even 2.4 in stable, but everything has it sane limits (: IMHO 2.6 is on this edge until 3.0 will happened. 

My motivation was to let it pass test suite as all other packages does during CI as far as aioredis actually works fine with 2.6 while leave version incompatibility issues for test suite of projects which uses aioredis.

Didn't look on coverage and entire project closely yet, just meet it on this weekends, but would be happy to!

PS: I've just looked at Gentoo and its packages and it just confuses me -- in terms of ""stable"" releases
they have `python 3.3.5`, `redis 2.6.15` but no `asyncio` and `hiredis-py`. Sounds like a joke.

Suddenly the only available versions are the ancient 2.2 and the current 2.8. I didn't found any 2.6 for precise so there are two options: brew the package or doing make. First is overkill, imho.

I agree that `redis-server --version` may not be the best way.
Let's make properly:
`redis-cli INFO SERVER`
that would return redis server info retrieved by client, everybody should be happy.
