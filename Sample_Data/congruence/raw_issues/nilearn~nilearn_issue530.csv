I feel the APi does simply not allow me to do keep the sign information, as the abs value seems to be implemented in relatively deep layers of viz vode (diaply.py module).
Wouldn't it make sense to give at lest support for signed rendering, where positive and negative regions would be displayed differently ?

"issue_comment","530","nilearn","nilearn","GaelVaroquaux","2015-04-03 12:22:45",":) You are the one who pushed for using max intensity projection, in
which case the sign looses sense.

One thing that would be possible with the current code would be to
threshold the map that you have to keep only the negative valuen, plot it
using the current glass brain and a blueish colormap. Than plot the
positive values only using the add_overlay method of the display returned
by plot_glass_brain.

If this solution ends up being a good solution that reliably plots good
visualization, we could include it in plot_glass_brain with a switch to
turn it on.
