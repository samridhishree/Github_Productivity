"issue_comment","390","idan","oauthlib","leonid-s-usov","2015-11-04 20:12:08","As I understand, there is: you should define your own subclass of the `GrantTypeBase` with your custom logic. 

Next, to use the grant type you would need to create your own `Server` class following pattern found in https://github.com/idan/oauthlib/blob/master/oauthlib/oauth2/rfc6749/endpoints/pre_configured.py

However, It seems that there could be a more elegant approach if the classes defined in `pre_configured.py` would allow for passing in as a parameter additional token and grant type handlers
