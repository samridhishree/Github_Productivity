This file causes pylint to crash:

```
class C(object): pass                                                                                                                                  
class D(C, object): pass                                                                                                                               
class B(object, C): pass                                                                                                                               
class A(B, D): pass                                                                                                                                    
```

This is the trace:

```
  File ""/nail/home/buck/pg/3/virtualenv_run/lib/python2.6/site-packages/pylint/checkers/utils.py"", line 532, in unimplemented_abstract_methods
    mro = reversed(node.mro())
  File ""/nail/home/buck/pg/3/virtualenv_run/lib/python2.6/site-packages/astroid/scoped_nodes.py"", line 1459, in mro
    return _c3_merge(unmerged_mro)
  File ""/nail/home/buck/pg/3/virtualenv_run/lib/python2.6/site-packages/astroid/scoped_nodes.py"", line 77, in _c3_merge
    for subsequence in sequences]
ValueError: zero length field name in format
```

This example was made by repeatedly simplifying the inheritance structure of `sqlalchemy.Column`, which causes pylint to crash similarly:

```
from sqlalchemy import Column                                                                                                                          

Column()                                                                                                                                               
```

Invalid. 

This was caused by my incomplete patch to re-add py26 support.
