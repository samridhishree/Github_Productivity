"issue_title","357","pycqa","astroid","The-Compiler","2016-08-20 10:56:28","This adds compatibility with pytest 3.0 to `brain_pytest.py`, where some attributes were added and others moved.

It also adds some failing attributes which are already present in older pytest versions, like `pytest.xfail` which existed for a long time.

In the second commit, I also re-added pytest 2.9 support (and it also seems to work fine with 2.7 still, didn't test older versions) as 3.0 is quite a big update and I don't expect everyone to upgrade immediately.

Since the default will go into 1.5.0, it could potentially take a while to be released, together with pylint 2.0, which is why I am asking.

I'm not sure what happens after upgrading to pytest 3.0 - the old code snippet would probably raise an `AttributeError`, but I don't get any `no-member` messages anyways?
