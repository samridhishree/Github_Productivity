a) swaps images according to x, y, z axes

b) inverts these axes also

cf. https://rcbi.rochester.edu/kjlee/BOLD%20fMRI%20Analysis/Documents/Conversion%20of%20DICOM%20to%20NII%20to%20use%20with%20FSL%20analyses.pdf

This can be helpful in many ways in everyday neuroimaging practice. For example, if you need
to extract seed regions (for whatever the neuroimaging analysis) but you only have a topographical template in one hemisphere, then you might want to swap that one into the other hemisphere. The same approach can also help to homogenize (seed) structures across hemispheres.
