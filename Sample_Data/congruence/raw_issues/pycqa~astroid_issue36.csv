While testing https://bitbucket.org/logilab/pylint/pull-request/119/emit-an-error-when-a-list-index-is-a-non/, I discovered the following bug in astroid.

```
#!python

  File ""C:\Python34\lib\site-packages\pylint-1.2.1-py3.4.egg\pylint\checkers\typecheck.py"", line 544, in visit_index
    parent_type = safe_infer(node.parent.value)
  File ""C:\Python34\lib\site-packages\pylint-1.2.1-py3.4.egg\pylint\checkers\utils.py"", line 86, in safe_infer
    value = next(inferit)
  File ""C:\Python34\lib\site-packages\astroid-1.1.1-py3.4.egg\astroid\bases.py"", line 313, in wrapped
    for res in _func(node, context, **kwargs):
  File ""C:\Python34\lib\site-packages\astroid-1.1.1-py3.4.egg\astroid\bases.py"", line 115, in _infer_stmts
    for infered in stmt.infer(context):
  File ""C:\Python34\lib\site-packages\astroid-1.1.1-py3.4.egg\astroid\bases.py"", line 313, in wrapped
    for res in _func(node, context, **kwargs):
  File ""C:\Python34\lib\site-packages\astroid-1.1.1-py3.4.egg\astroid\inference.py"", line 358, in infer_ass
    stmts = list(self.assigned_stmts(context=context))
  File ""C:\Python34\lib\site-packages\astroid-1.1.1-py3.4.egg\astroid\protocols.py"", line 213, in assend_assigned_stmts
    return self.parent.assigned_stmts(self, context=context)
AttributeError: 'Starred' object has no attribute 'assigned_stmts'

Reproducing using:

```
#!python

for (*a, val) in ((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)):
   a[0]

Another reproducing case:

def func(sequence):
    head, *tail = sequence
    return reversed(tail)

Implement the assigned_stmts operation for Starred nodes.

This was omitted when support for Python 3 was added in astroid.
It currently works only for Starred nodes in assignments and only
for the most common of cases, such as `a, *b = (1, 2, 3)`.
Closes issue #36.
