``` python
from docutils.core import publish_parts
publish_parts(myfunc.__doc__)
```

``` python
help(myfunc)

Could somebody share if they have other clever utils to deal with this doc problems ?
Currently, I have documentation errors with megatrawls data fetcher.  For instance ""Unexpected indentation"". I assume that it is because I used 5 References in my doc ?

Does somebody have any clue on what `54` represents ?
`<string>:54: (ERROR/3) Unexpected indentation.`
