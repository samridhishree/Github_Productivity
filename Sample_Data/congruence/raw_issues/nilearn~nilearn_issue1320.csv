However I'm having issues with the node_coords, as they end up outside of the glass brain.

I'm trying also to get each region node by computing the center_of_mass (as I found in some previous issues here), but there's still issues. So what is the coordinate frame here? What do you mean by world space?

I get the x,y,z of that new file, and when I plot it, it's kinda in the glass brain, but not quite:
