"issue_title","298","pycqa","astroid","PCManticore","2015-12-19 21:47:59","This patch adds /usr/lib/python{ver} and /usr/lib64/python{ver} to the list of places where a standard module library could be found.  Issues such as https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/725 are occurring because those modules are found in /usr/lib64/python2.7, which were not looked before by modutils.is_standard_module. @The-Compiler since you're more familiar with Unix systems that me, do you find this approach safe? Can there be extension packages installed there instead of /usr/local/lib/python{ver} on other OSes? The idea is to have a list of standard library places, so that is_standard_module(module_name) returns true for them, which in certain cases could lead to importing those modules if they are C extensions, so this might not be safe if third party modules get installed there.
