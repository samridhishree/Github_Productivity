Fix semantic problems in cache_mixin that led to misuse of the functions. Shorten the code.

Roadmap:
- [X] In `_utils/cache_mixin.py`, put all the code into the function `cache` (remove duplicate). The code in `CacheMixin` should be a wrapper around `cache`
- [X] Rename `ref_memory_level` to `func_memory_level` to avoid ambiguity.
- [X] Put `None` as default for both parameters
- [x] Check all occurences of caching in the code
- [X] Add a test on memory level

- Could you add tests to test the cache invalidation code?  There are two different warnings, a test to trigger each pathway seems appropriate.
  *Could you add `verbose=0` to your `Memory` object to avoid output in the test?
