``` python
                 if self.n_components > subject_pca.shape[0]:
                    raise ValueError('You asked for %i components.'
                                     'This is smaller than single-subject '
                                     'data size.' % self.n_components)
```

Two fixes, one suggestion:
- `smaller` should be `larger`.
- Whitespace is missing between the two sentences.
- Suggest: also output the single-subject data size, to help the user debug.

I coded this on my machine as:

``` python
                 if self.n_components > subject_pca.shape[0]:
                    raise ValueError('You asked for %i components. '
                                     'This is larger than the single-subject '
                                     'data size (%d).' % (self.n_components,
                                                          subject_pca.shape[0]))
```

Bonus message if you add a test where you check the error message if there is none already.

I will take a look at the test situation and do a PR sometime soon!
