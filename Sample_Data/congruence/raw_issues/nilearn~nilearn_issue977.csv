Yes but I am not sure which one? 

Also I am not sure whether we normalize on (vmin, vmax) or (0, vmax) ?
For example below one, we have vmin values always even if the threshold is high 98%. Any suggestions are welcome.

Yup. I am hazarding a wild guess, it may be the case that there is some code to leave some additional space for the colorbar that is not inherited in the plot_connectome case.

The `im` argument in _colorbar_show is expected to be some kind of image object as produced by plt.imshow (matplotlib.image.AxesImage), hence the name. At least this is what happening in the rest of the code. Suddenly you are passing some kind of axis object which is very surprising. ""How can that even work"" is how I felt until I realised that the .cmap and .norm attributes were set on the GlassBrainAxes instance just for the sole purpose of making _colorbar_show work.

> The question is whether we accept to have this hack until somebody decide to clean this code.

I would say yes if we want this to be in the release. Clear no, otherwise, but that just my feeling.

I don't think it is that much work to do what I proposed. There may be better alternatives too.

By definition, the classes defined here with suffix ""Axes"" are supposed to be classes compatible with matplotlib Axes in order to be able to feed them to functions that are supposed to process Axes... So, in my sense, this hack makes sense in that context.

Is that actually true? I thought they were just wrapping a matplotlib Axes through their `.ax` attribute.
