Whats new doc says: ""Dropped support for scikit-learn 0.14 Minimum supported version is now 0.15"".

What I see from version.py is minimum required is 0.14.1.
https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/nilearn/version.py

and from travis
https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/.travis.yml

Question: According to doc string, minimum version should be changed to 0.15 or doc string needs to be changed ?","start issue","Drop Scikit Learn < 0.15"

I suggest to release 0.3 first (we're in the beta window, and we've been
in the beta window too long) and fix this after.
