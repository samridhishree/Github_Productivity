I think that you should use the stacklevel argument of warnings.warn.

"pull_request_commit_comment","1247","nilearn","nilearn","AlexandreAbraham","2016-08-17 13:10:14","Returning an empty image was a good idea. Maybe you could do something like:

``` python
        input_img = new_img_like(maps_img, np.zeros(maps_img.shape[:3] + (0,))
```

If we do that, we will have a truly empty 4d image. However, this may break what happens next, for example if you try to plot it with prob_atlas. We have to think about it.

I thought the same and felt that returning given image as it is would be safe and valid.

Plus, the length of `regions_extracted_img` and `index_of_each_map` should be the same, which is not the case with your current code.

I am not against returning special values in case of error to keep the pipeline running, but what you do here may be mlisleading for people.

Before wasting your precious time changing code, maybe we should wait for the input of GaÃ«l? He is the one that knows the users best.
