This causes a TypeError ('NoneType' object is not iterable) when trying to init the OAuth2Token class.  (Because it is wrapped in a set()).

Possible solution is to try, except TypeError around this call in tokens.py line 30

Or possibly I'm missing something entirely.

Wouldn't it be better to return an empty list?

The Oauth2 may not return a scope in the response if it didn't change which scope was requested. More info on #306 as well. 

I am not sure why but another person I know using Google + flask-oauthlib doesn't get this error but I can create it 100% of the time.

If you're stuck and don't have the luxury of waiting on a release, you can host the compliance fixes in your own code.

The ""client authentication"" is always required in the current method `validate_revocation_request`. There are cases that the authentication can be ignored though, like when grand type is ""Resource Owner Password Credentials"" and the ""Client type"" is Public.

The patch makes this possible so you can just pass a client_id (without secret) to revoke a token.

@ib-lundgren could you please take a look at this one :)
