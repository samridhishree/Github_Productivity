"issue_comment","1326","nilearn","nilearn","shoshber","2016-11-15 21:17:09","Ah, sorry, I meant to come back and flesh this out. Since the return value of `plotting.plot_*` functions should be closed (`retval.close()`), a context manager that can do that automatically would be üëç, since it reduces the chance of programmer error . Similar to python's built-in context manager for opening files (`with open('file.txt'):`). An example implementation: https://github.com/nipy/nipype/blob/master/nipype/utils/tmpdirs.py. Should be quick enough work, but I don't have time to do it myself at the moment!
