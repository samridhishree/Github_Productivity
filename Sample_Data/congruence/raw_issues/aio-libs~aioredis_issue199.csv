AttributeError: 'RedisPool' object has no attribute 'execute'


After checking the code, I'm able to use connection pool successfully by replacing pool.execute with context manager way:
``` python
    async with pool.get() as conn:
        await conn.set('my-key', 'value')

    async with pool.get() as conn:
        print(await conn.get('my-key'))
```

v0.3.0 still has old pool version, I recommend to go forward and use latest version (yet unreleased).
See latest docs here — http://aioredis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference.html#connections-pool","",""
