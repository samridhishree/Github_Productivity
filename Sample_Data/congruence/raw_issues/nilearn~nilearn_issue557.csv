No, I'd rather have a sane behavior. It's fairly easy to implement.

``` python
display = plotting.plot_anat()
display = plotting.plot_anat(threshold=0)
display = plotting.plot_anat(threshold='auto')
```

I got the same output as below:

are we good enough for a pull request ?

I don't know, why would a user pass a threshold parameter if it is not listed as an explicit parameter and not documented?

Maybe the simplest thing to do is actually to go the other way on this one: allow an optional 'threshold' parameter that defaults to None (i.e. not thresholded) in plot_anat ?

My contention with having some kwargs logic is that it is rather brittle. For example should we protect against resampling_interpolation being passed into the kwargs as well? Should we do this only in plot_anat or also in other plot_ functions that set threshold to a fixed value internally?
