We have manual sys.path modification as a part of our project configuration.

```
#!python

def path_config():
    for path in [THIRD_PARTY_DIR]:
        if path not in sys.path:
            sys.path.insert(0, path)
```

Right now pylint can not understand what is going on and returns an error:

```
Unable to import '%packagename%' (import-error)
```

It would be nice to understand this kind of things, or have a method to manually add a path to pylint.
