"issue_title","162","idan","oauthlib","synasius","2013-05-27 08:09:19","It would be helpful to add request.redirect_uri in the error object for non FatalClientError, so one can easily redirect. Otherwise the app using oauthlib needs to evaluate the correct redirect_uri itself

For instance, in Django

``` python
uri, http_method, body, headers = self._extract_params(request)
try:
    scopes, credentials = server.validate_authorization_request(uri, http_method, body, headers)
    ...
except errors.FatalClientError as e:
    # show local error page

except errors.AccessDeniedError as e:
    # redirect the user as documented in http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.2.1
    url = ""{0}?{1}"".format(e.redirect_uri, e.urlencode)
    return HttpResponseRedirect(url)
