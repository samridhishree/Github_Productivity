What kind of prediction scores are you getting?

I am puzzled that the non-zero voxels are different from in the map that were obtained by mass-univariate approach. The voxel selection here is relying on an ANOVA. I agree that it is not permuted, but that should only be a problem of setting the threshold.

It is not as mature as the predictive modeling part. Right now nilearn is
in it's early stage, and we need to make sure that the markert most what
is most mature (ie Anova + SVM :$ ).

Technically, not a full copy is needed, but I think the engineering costs around generating a fake file (and associated catching of the specific test use-case) are greater than that of chipping the full CSV file into Nilearn.
This statement is true conditionally to the fact that several examples behave that way, otherwise the engineering costs associated with handling the current `nilearn_data/data` directory management are then greater.

Should I open an issue about that?

Your test fails here. You ask for an integer substitution but `n_subjects` is None. Also, I'm not in favor of raising a warning if n_subjects is None. This means that the user will get a warning by calling the function with its default parameters.
