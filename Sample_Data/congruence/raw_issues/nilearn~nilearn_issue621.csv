"pull_request_commit_comment","621","nilearn","nilearn","AlexandreAbraham","2015-06-29 14:43:54","Small remark: the problem is not the function `masked_equal` itself but the fact that we do `-threshold` on an unisgned value. I'm afraid that this gag will happen here and there in the code (typically in the colorbar code). That's only a supposition but maybe we should try to find a solution and propagate it through the code?

"pull_request_commit_comment","621","nilearn","nilearn","lesteve","2015-06-29 16:52:06","Funny you should say that, since there is indeed a bug I bumped into while trying to tweak the test I added. The colorbar code is where it blows up but I believe the problem is more `vmin = -vmax` in plot_stat_map. There is also a `-offset` somewhere in the colorbar code to be fair.

Maybe converting to float before plotting is the simpler option, after all ?
