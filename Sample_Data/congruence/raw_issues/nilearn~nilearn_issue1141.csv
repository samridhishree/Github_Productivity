"issue_comment","1141","nilearn","nilearn","AlexandreAbraham","2016-06-20 20:58:50","Thanks for the PR. 3 remarks though (with points to discuss):
- examples relying on haxby_simple must be updated
- we should probably discuss if we remove it bluntly or if we ""deprecate it"" (and make it rely on fetch_haxby)
- the test of haxby_simple is the only one to actually ""download"" a file (it is a dummy file from the repo itself) and therefor to test the full dataset fetching process. We have to replace it by another one (can be done in a separate PR).

"issue_comment","1141","nilearn","nilearn","Joaoloula","2016-07-02 10:36:22","Actually, just substituting the function breaks most examples, seeing as the simple fetcher can be loaded with `np.loadtxt` and returns an int-coded target, which `fetch_haxby` does not. I was actually working on this as well and made another PR fixing the examples, deprecating the function and adding a new test for the dummy file: hope that's alright!
