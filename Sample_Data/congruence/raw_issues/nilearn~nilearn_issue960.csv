To me the file path is not correct: it contains the full path whereas it should only be the relative path.
Example:
`nilearn/tests/test_testing.py`
instead of
`/home/travis/miniconda2/envs/testenv/lib/python3.5/site-packages/nilearn-0.2.1-py3.5.egg/nilearn/tests/test_testing.py`

Otherwise you can end up with all your CI tests working but your package on PyPI broken.

I think I have managed to set it up correctly via the coveralls website in the past. The annoying thing is that you need to redo it for each release. Last time I tried I couldn't get it to work IIRC.

As an alternative, you could run nosetests locally with --cover-html. It will generate an html that will show you which lines are not covered. For the record CircleCI is doing it (different python version than the one used in Travis for coveralls though) and you can find it in the artifacts.

Thanks. It would be great if you could document this somewhere (like in a
README_development.rst, or any other place you think is relevant).

It works now. What did you change on the configuration ?

> Maybe adding a rst file in doc/developers ?

That's an idea. There's already an issue for this (#891), maybe this could be discussed there.
