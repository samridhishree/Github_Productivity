You need to put it in the description of the PR (and IIRC you have to do it when you create the PR you can not edit the PR description later to add it).

The github [doc](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests) about closing issue from PR and the list of [magical keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) you can use.
