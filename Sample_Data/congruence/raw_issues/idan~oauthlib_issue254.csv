If it breaks anything, you should increase other version numbers instead of the bug fix number.

I agree, the ""mid"" version number should have been bumped. I feel that definitely is not enough however and I need to get some better release practices going. 

As a start I'll modify the Makefile to allow easy testing of a few key libraries like flask-oauthlib. Before release I'll make sure tests pass for all these libraries with the new version of oauthlib. If I break stuff I'll let you know with an issue or PR.

In addition, from now, before each release I'll create a ""release"" issue here where I mention/ping everyone who is interested and postpone release until I get enough thumbs up.

The [`Makefile`](https://github.com/idan/oauthlib/blob/456d85faf277b130a8710a5744e04b13caa72747/Makefile) looks like it's been modified as discussed, and you've modified your release process to include getting feedback from downstream library maintainers. I suggest closing this ticket.

"issue_comment","254","idan","oauthlib","ib-lundgren","2014-10-23 18:30:43","After the Makefile changes I ran make test and everything worked, which is
suspicious and I simply assumed it was not working properly. I never closed
the ticket because I wanted to confirm it working properly and didn't get
around to doing so until now.
