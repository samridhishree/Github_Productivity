"issue_title","355","nilearn","nilearn","banilo","2015-01-17 23:43:01","Perhaps the docstrings for the following classes could be improved:

```
- NiftiMasker
- NiftiLabelsMasker
- NiftiMapsMasker
- MultiNiftiMasker
```

More specifically, at the top of the respective class docstrings, one might add
- a more generous explanation of the purpose of the class
- its commonalities and differences comparing to the respective other masker classes
- provide one simple use case when this is typically useful

Apart from that, a new nilearn example might be useful that uses the various masker and, thus, gives an overview of this part of the API.

Edited by @AlexandreAbraham:

Here is the list of remarks made on _Nifti_Masker doc across issues:
- [ ] Specify which data is detrended (#418)
- [ ] Add intersect_masks to NiftiMasker's ""related functions"" (#436)
- [ ] Specify that only `mask_args` and `mask_strategy` are used for fitting. It's specified in the class docstring, but not on the fit function docstring (#436). Gael suggested to add it in the Notes section.
- [ ] Add in transform (#436):
  - Parameters (detrend, standardize) are computed from the images passed to transform (i.e. not computed and stored from fit)
  - Whether the inverse of these parameters is applied when inverse_transform is called (not sure if they are, for detrend, standardize, and confounds).
- [ ] NiftiMapsMasker and NiftiLabelsMasker don't have docstring for fit_transforms (#603).

In the 'notes' section.

I wonder if this should not be in the narrative documentation of the
maskers, rather than in the docstring. One of the reasons is that I am
afraid of duplication of the information.

Nope. It might be good to have a notebook-like example on that.

"issue_comment","355","nilearn","nilearn","AlexandreAbraham","2015-02-17 21:20:51","@bcipolli's comments from #436 
1. Please add `intersect_masks` to `NiftiMasker`'s ""related functions"" would be appreciated.
2. I suggest adding to the docstring of fit, to reminds users that only `mask_args` and `mask_strategy` are used for fitting.  It's specified in the class docstring, but not on the `fit` function docstring.
3. Lastly, I would find it helpful to specify (here or in transform) that:
   - Parameters (detrend, standardize) are computed from the images passed to transform (i.e. not computed and stored from fit)
   - Whether the inverse of these parameters is applied when inverse_transform is called (not sure if they are, for detrend, standardize, and confounds).
   
   My reasoning for this: my lab does computer vision, and the setup here differs from how our lab (and I believe others in this area) preprocess our datasets.  We compute and store whitening transforms for our training set, then apply them to test and validation sets (which are assumed to come from the same distribution of images as the training set).  I think very clear documentation about the use of these maskers could help avoid confusion for people like me coming from other fields as to the intended use of these maskers.
