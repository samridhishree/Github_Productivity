We want smaller datasets for the tutorials. If during a tutorial a user
just types this function with no arguments, we want to download only 30
subjects, as it's enough for most things.

That requirement comes from my experience teaching tutorials.

The original issue #897 talked about CircleCI, this is why I was puzzled.

What is puzzling me here is: Is nilearn a tool made for tutorials or for studies? People that wants to actually study this dataset may be puzzled by this behavior.

I would be in favor of creating a `fetch_tutorial_adhd` for this special purpose. Because, if space is the only issue, I suggest to restrain the study to the lighter subjects. Here are some stats:

| Dataset | Control/ADHD count | Size in MB |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full ADHD | 20/20 | 1791.88 |
| 30 first subjects of ADHD | 15/15 | 1305.22 |
| 30 smaller subjects of ADHD | 16/14 | 1128.36 |
| 24 smaller subjects of ADHD | 13/11 | 785.87 |
| 15 smaller subjects of ADHD | 8/7 | 398.28 |

But the datasets are only for tutorials / demos. And beside, it's just
like the fetch_haxby, which only downloads 1 subject by default.

How about we keep it simple and don't over engineer things. It's just a
question of changing a default, from n_subjects=None to n_subjects=30.

We've already checked that all the examples work well with only 30
subjects, so we can just stick to the simple solution.
