Hi,

at our build environment we do a test with each commit. Since 2015-07-27 we have an issue with dependencies:

```
#!python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py"", line 2806, in <module>
    working_set.require(__requires__)

    needed = self.resolve(parse_requirements(requirements))
  File ""/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py"", line 598, in resolve
    raise VersionConflict(dist,req) # XXX put more info here
pkg_resources.VersionConflict: (logilab-common 1.0.2 (/usr/local/lib/python3.3/dist-packages), Requirement.parse('logilab-common<=0.63.0'))
```

Where as installation went fine:

```

When I try to point pip3 to the last working version of pylint I get:

When I pin logilab-common to 0.62.0 then everything works fine.
