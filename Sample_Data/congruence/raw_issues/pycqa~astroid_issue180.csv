Given the following code, astroid doesn't understand the fact that the result will always be `24`, instead it returns an union between the global and the value from the enclosing scope.

```
#!python

from astroid.test_utils import extract_node
n = extract_node('''
next = 42
def wrapper(next=next):     
     next = 24
     def test():
         return next
     return test
wrapper()() #@
''')
f = n.inferred()
print(f)
print(f[0].value)
```
