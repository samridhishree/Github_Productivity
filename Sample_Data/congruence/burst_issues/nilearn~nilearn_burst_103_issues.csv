```set_facecolor``` seems to be implemented from matplotlib 2.0 but not from 1.5 if I understood correctly.

Can anybody see this problem ? It would be great if you could try at some time. Thanks.

Yes, it happened to me on master. When I hacked a bit code to check for >= 2.0, it succeeded.

How do I see on which version of matplotlib is CircleCI build running ?",,

I don't buy this result. AFAIK packages other than GIFT do variance normalization.

I think that the optimality of this choice depends on what you are doing.
