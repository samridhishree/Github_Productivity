With the addition of the OAuth class (not sure its a good name) it is now very simple to use the OAuthLib features for any client interacting with an OAuth server. Convenience methods for anyone implementing an OAuth server are on their way and will include verification of authorization headers, request uri queries and form encoded bodies with all three signatures methods. A method for generating any type of token is already added and I will need to research a bit more what other methods might be convenient.

o = OAuth(client_key=""some key"", client_secret=""secret"")
header = o.auth_header(""http://www.example.com/authorize"")

where header will be a string formatted for use as an Authorization header in a request.

Added support for extracting query parameters as per 3.4.1.3.1.
The parameters does not have to be unique, thus I have modified for use of a list of tuples instead of a dictionary
The parameters were escaped one time to much, removed.
Both client and access secret can be empty, not only access. Per 3.4.2.
Added a few tests based on the RFC and http://hueniverse.com/oauth/guide/authentication/
