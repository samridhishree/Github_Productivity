I'm currently working on moving the django decorator into its own django extension library and ran into this redirect uri issues literally minutes ago. https://github.com/ib-lundgren/django-oauthlib/blob/master/django_oauthlib/views.py#L66.

By the way I have seen your new https://github.com/ib-lundgren/django-oauthlib project.
We are on a similar project started right after DjangoConEU: https://github.com/evonove/django-oauth-toolkit
Our goal is to provide a simple Django app that helps developer to add oauth2 and oauth1 support in their projects. We use oauthlib in the backend of course!

Project is under active development and we planned to get these features at minimum:
- oauth2 provider supporting all the standard workflows
- oauth2 client facilities
  If you are interested we would be happy to get you involved :-)

"issue_comment","166","idan","oauthlib","ib-lundgren","2013-05-29 13:47:31","Ah cool. Sounds exactly what I had in mind, minus the client bits as I
think it would be better to focus solely on creating a great provider
extension/app.

I've not done very much yet, only begun yesterday and most time was spent
getting random project structure setup. Thought I'd do it mainly to learn
about django and see if it caught any traction but we should definitely see
if we can merge our work. Fancy dropping into irc? #oauthlib on freenode.
