With the current tip of astroid, pylint-python3 still warns about no-argument `super()` used on old-style classes, which is obviously wrong.  I guess this can be fixed by changing the check in `TreeRebuilder.visit_class` (`newnode._newstyle = metaclass in ('type', 'ABCMeta')`) to include also the case `sys.version_info > (3,)`.

I'm interested in this issue, I'll have a look in the weekend. In the past I investigated this problem, the only things left after adding your suggested check was that there were warnings about missing **init** (no-init warning) and `.bases` didn't contain `object` for Python 3, which could potentially lead to some problems (like missing attributes? although I'm not certain if this is the case).

Claudiu, imo the pb is simply that 'newstyle' attribute should always be
true w/ Python3. At some point we may want to inject 'object' in the base
classes but that shouldn't be necessary at a first glance.

All class nodes are marked as new style classes for Py3k, closes #12.
