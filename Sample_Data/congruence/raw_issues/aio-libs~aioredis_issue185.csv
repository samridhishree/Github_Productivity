"issue_comment","185","aio-libs","aioredis","dpereira","2017-04-13 18:24:24","Hello, @popravich, we're very interested in using aioredis with sentinel support. It seems this is the last task related to it in the 1.0 milestone. 

I'd like to understand if the code is already functional, or if there are any other pending issues for sentinel support.

Regards.","",""

Sentinel support is available in master, it is functional.
However few things are missing: dynamic peers discovery; more docs & more tests.
Some docs are here â€” http://aioredis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sentinel.html","",""
