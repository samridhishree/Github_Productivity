I have been using nilearn for a few weeks already. Actually, I need more technical explanation many times because I cannot figure out what a function does from the name of the function. For example, To understand what fit_transform function does in NiftiLabelsMasker, I had to read code. But if there were a little explanation like ""fit_transform calculates mean of the signal in the region"", I would not have to read the code.

I agree that quite often the docstrings could be improved. We're trying to work on it slowly. I think that you should feel free to send small PRs when you have a better version of a docstring.

I'll change the title of this issue to ""Improve docsrings: more technical details"", to make it easier to understand what it is about at a cursory look.","",""
