In order to deal with both resampled and non-resampled version, we need to implement a mechanism that checks the presence or absence of the resampled or original files. 

WIP - currently I'm not happy with the way it's implemented, because it ONLY works if you use the `mode=overwrite` in the fetch_neurovault functions. 

This is because I implemented the caching mechanism at the lowest level (download function), but the check for downloaded images seems to happen earlier.
