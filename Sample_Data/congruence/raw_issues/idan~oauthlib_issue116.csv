OAuth and OAuth2 are hard to compare, provide different workflow and requirements for the source and target systems. Making implementation for them separated helps to keep single responsibility principle for the sake of simplicity.

"issue_comment","116","idan","oauthlib","ib-lundgren","2013-02-18 18:03:32","From the users perspective I doubt two libraries will be any better than one in this case. What a user would benefit from is clear and exhaustive documentation with many examples. An area where we admittedly are lacking greatly at the moment but certainly is high priority. Solid documentation could easily rid any confusion of when to use OAuth 1 or 2. 

Regarding when to use OAuth 1 or 2 I've opened issue #118 .
Clarifying that oauthlib separates 1 and 2 is now issue #117 .
One thing I've been meaning to add is a F.A.Q. for clients and providers to address common issues quickly. I've opened issue #119  tracking this.

The reason the documentation is lacking is twofold. Firstly I avoid writing documentation before I feel the interface has matured enough to be usable by users uninterested in digging into internals themselves. Until then the unittests and code serve as documentation. Secondly, I currently can't spend nearly as much time as I'd like on OAuthLib.

"issue_comment","116","idan","oauthlib","ib-lundgren","2013-02-21 10:49:08","Exhaustive might not be the right word for it. What I hope to eventually
have is a wide span of different documentation, from quick tips to
tutorials to in depth analysis. OAuth, especially 2, is notoriously hard to
get right and I think there is much that can be done to help users, be it
in code or docs.
