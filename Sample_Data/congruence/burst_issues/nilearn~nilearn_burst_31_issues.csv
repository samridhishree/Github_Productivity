When trying to add e.g.

I wonder if we should load nilearn submodules on import. I don't think so
because it leads to tight coupling that mean that if something, somewhere
is broken, nothing in nilearn is usable. We can easily add it afterward,
if we find that we should focus more on usability than portability.
Removing it as an afterthought, on the other side, would be breaking
compatibility.

That's a hack. Hacks are bad: they give bad habits and eventually break.

I agree, and this is why we have to keep the option open to change our minds. However I want to get a better feeling of where nilearn is going before switching to an ""import everything"" strategy.

But the translation vector is hard to compute. Such a function is in
practice very hard to use. I find it counter intuitive to give a random
translation vector and then tell the function to ignore it. I find it
much more natural to not give a translation vector at all.

I think that this is a theoretical argument and that people haven't had
any difficulty using this code. It's success compared to alternative
resampling implementation tell us that the API is not too poorly defined.

We could have a separate function for 3x3 and 4x4 transformations, but a

No, it often comes from nowhere. For instance you want to work on a voxel

If this usecase is questionable, then the 3D target affine given and no target shape needs to be reexamined as well.

In any case, what nilearn was doing up until now, which is using the old shape of the functional file for the resampled image,  does not make any sense at all (cf the test I added in the first commit). So either we remove the optionality of the arguments target_affine and target_shape, or raise if affine 4D given and not target shape, or we make it do sensible things if some data are missing.

This should also be the case then for transformations with prescribed shape, in which case some refactoring of the decision tree in the function is necessary (this is the case anyway).

Another possibility we have is to warn if only part of the data will be visible in the positive orthant of the affine. This functionality can detect unwanted croppings, but may become annoying if cropping was intended. I would like to hear your opinion on this before making the changes.

All of these propositions are easy to implement - I just want to make sure I'm doing the right thing.

target shape given but not target affine ==> raise
target shape given but not with exactly 3 entries ==> raise
neither target shape nor target affine given ==> return img or copy of img
if target affine is really close to affine and shapes identical ==> return img or copy of img

This leaves us in the situation where there is definitely a target affine given which is different from the current one. I'll now describe how things were, how they are now, and how I think they should be.

Status was: (Starting from l205, after the intro)
- if no target shape given, put original shape as target shape (<-- the useless behaviour we discussed)
- if affine shape is (3, 3), estimate bounding box, which includes estimating affine offset (origin) and shape (whether it is given or not).

So affine shape (3, 3) overrides target_shape = orig_shape whether it was specified or not

Status in PR:
- if no target shape given, then if affine shape is (4, 4), estimate bounding box sensibly, keeping origin defined by affine, and including all data that is in positive orthant of affine. Else set target shape to original shape (<--- this case will always be overwritten now)
- if affine shape is (3, 3) do what is done above

So here, as we see, even if temporarily target shape is set to original shape, it will never stay that way, so this branch should be removed.

My proposition:
- calculate bounding box of data under the new affine
- if 4D affine is given, then if any of the 3 max values of the bounding box is < 0, raise BoundingBoxException, because whether shape is given or not, none of the data will be seen, since none of it is in the positive orthant of the given affine.
  (- optionally: if 4D affine is given, and any of the min values of the bounding box are < 0, possibly warn that some data will be cropped)
- if 4D affine is given and no shape specified, calculate shape using bounding box
- if 3D affine is given and no shape specified, calculate shape and affine origin using bounding box
- proceed to resampling

One case is missing totally. What if 3D affine is given and shape specified? This should possibly raise an Exception, since we don't know how the user would like the origin placed ...

Contrary to the previous version which checked only equality to 0, this makes a floating point copy of the image instead of only one binary one and leads to higher memory consumption.

@AlexandreAbraham's first remark was this, along with the proposition to evaluate the infinity norm using max(array.max(), -array.min()) and identifying threshold passing using a logical or on negative or positive threshold passing.

This makes 2-3 binary copies instead of the equivalent of around 8-9 for the floating point absolute value. A clear gain in memory usage, but a potential loss in code readability. Where do we set the tradeoff?

Yes. I figured that in the mean time, and decided it was a bad idea.

This is really a nilearn question, not a scikit-learn question. Contrasts
have no meaning in scikit-learn. We are going to have to come up with our
own API here.

resample_img will not calculate a new bounding box for the data and will keep exactly the same shape as the original data. This leads, in several cases I have had, to completely empty views on the data. A test will follow.

Proposition:
Act similarly to resample_img given a 3D affine. In this case, this coordinate origin is unknown and nilearn calculates a bounding box around the data and sets the new origin to one corner of this box.
Given a 4D affine, resample_img should also recalculate a bounding box in order to be sure to contain the full data that were to be transformed. However, the coordinate origin should be adopted from the given affine.

How does this sound?
