"issue_title","839","nilearn","nilearn","bcipolli","2015-11-10 16:36:48","This PR attempts to solve three issues:
- `_fetch_files` cannot overwrite existing files (note: `_fetch_file` actually allows this)
- `_fetch_file`'s `overwrite=True` flag is not tested.
- `setup_mock`, `teardown_mock`, `setup_tmpdata`, `teardown_tmpdata` is copied across `datasets/tests/test_*.py`, including an orphaned copy in `test_utils.py`.

The first is the only one I care about; the other two I dealt with while trying to test this.

I would like to use this functionality in the NeuroVault downloader. Since those datasets are dynamic, previous data may need to be overwritten.
