Diffculties:
- my code is generic but very ugly and I'm not happy with it. It needs love.
- random walker and region growing approaches rely completely on the (great) scikit image code for region segmentation. I don't think that we should do our own code (a naive implementation is way slower and writing an optimized implementation takes time) so we have to decide if we add the code in nilearn.externals (the solution I chose so far) or put a dependency on scikit image for that.
- a lot of work in doc and example is also required.

Not all of the methods. Just the one or two that works best.
