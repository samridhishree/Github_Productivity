I have trouble understanding on which behavior of nibabel we can rely or not. nibabel caching is evolving and becoming more and more cusomizable. I would not be surprised that a global option to disable it arise in a near future. Anyway I just thought that avoiding calling the same method twice in a row was good practice.

I am working on resting-state network templates using the ICA output from MIALAB's GIFT and the Allen RSN templates.
I have implemented a class that:
- reads the GIFT RSN template input format (a nifti and a txt file with labels and indices),
- gives a few helpers to work with these files, and
- measures goodness-of-fit (as in Zhou et al., Brain, 2010) and correlation against a given set of subject IC spatial maps.

My questions:
1) is there any plan to do subject reconstruction of the spatial maps from group CanICA or DictLearning? If yes, any interest in doing it? I could start this, but would definitely need help with the maths, or any reference to the method that you prefer.
2) Is there any interest in this RSN templates development to be included in nilearn?

If yes, any comment on how to proceed, I would love to contribute.

This is a WIP of what I mention:
https://github.com/Neurita/pypes/blob/rsn/pypes/postproc/rsn.py
I would move outside the more complex functions in the class, and also optimise them.

Scikit-learn implements the Jaccard Index in the specific setting of measuring clustering similarity. Here we have a fuzzy extension of the measure that will probably not be accepted in sklearn because there is no ""best"" way to make this extension.

I assume this is because nilearn does not explicitly set the matplotlib backend as `agg`. Can you confirm that this is indeed what is causing the error? Since nilearn does not depend on gtk (and I believe rightfully so) I think the test phase should not fail if there happens to be no gtk support in matplotlib.

If you look at the file `nilearn/plotting/__init__.py`, you'll see that we have some code to use the `agg` backend if no sidplay is available. I guess that somehow this code is not working properly on your machine. Could you:
- tell us how you launch the test suite so that we can reproduce
- try to copy/paste the code in the beginning of init and then check that the backend has been switched to `agg` (using `matplotlib.get_backend()`)
- check that you don't have a maplotlib.rc file in your current dir on anything at python loading (maybe an `ipython_config.py`) that pre-set a different matplotlb backend (because in that case, nilearn cannot reset it).

As a reminder, the code to be run:

``` python
def _set_mpl_backend():
    try:
        # We are doing local imports here to avoid poluting our namespace
        import matplotlib
        import os
        import sys
        # Set the backend to a non-interactive one for unices without X
        if (os.name == 'posix' and 'DISPLAY' not in os.environ
            and not (sys.platform == 'darwin'
                     and matplotlib.get_backend() == 'MacOSX'
                     )):
            matplotlib.use('Agg')
            print('Switching backend to agg')
    except ImportError:
        from .._utils.testing import skip_if_running_nose
        # No need to fail when running tests

        # When matplotlib was successfully imported we need to check
        # that the version is greater that the minimum required one
        _import_module_with_version_check('matplotlib',

1,issue_title,1286,nilearn,nilearn,rschmaelzle,2016-09-21 13:35:15,"Dear developers,
i am trying to create a schmatic brain visualization that I don't know the name for - a not-quite volumetric, not-quite-surface view. Let's assume I'd extract 4d data from a parcellation, e.g. the AAL90. That would give me a 90*TR array, which I'd wish to visualize on a schematic brain similar to the lateral or medial glass brain, just with more 'tiles'. The best analogy I can think of is a geomap, and there seem to be very useful packages for that, e.g. [kartograph](http://kartograph.org/showcase/choropleth/) (also brain-shapes exist e.g. [here](https://scalablebrainatlas.incf.org/main/coronal3d.php?template=EAZ05&). Currently, I use cumbersome code to loop over a volumetric file to assign the same value to all voxels within the same ROI/parcel/region and then use simple plot_stat_map. However, a schematic would be nice, visually appealing, and smaller in terms of file-size that carries the data. 
i) is there possibly a better way to achieve what I want?
ii) if not, does it sound interesting or sth similar in planning?
iii) if not, is it even desirable? I cannot promise I am up to the task of implementing ,but could see what we can do.
Thanks, R

Let's say a common volume size is 70x70x70 in float32. This is ~1350KB, and usually for a Numpy operation you need space for 3 volumes: left hand size, right hand side and the temporary result.

I am trying to extract resting state network with Canica and/or Dict_learning from the Abide dataset. 
I chose the UM sample and downloaded the data after dparsf pre-processing (abide pre-processed).

When launching CanICA, I get a ""mask is invalid as it is empty"" error. 
As I didn't managed to extract the mask from the fmri images, I downloaded a mask for each subject from the abide repository and produced a mask for the dataset using Niftimasker. 
I created a list named ""mask"" with all the masks of the subjects and tried : 

`masker = NiftiMasker(mask_strategy='background', mask_args=dict(opening=8))`
`masker.fit(mask)`

and get  :

As the result was not perfect, I tried (even if the epi strategy should not be applied in this case because I am using a mask and not an fmri image)

`masker = NiftiMasker(mask_strategy='epi',mask_args=dict(upper_cutoff=.79,lower_cutoff=.77,opening=False))`
`masker.fit(mask)`
`plot_roi(masker.mask_img_, title='Mask-Nilearn')`

and get :

which is a little better. 

However the mask is not covering all the brain so I am wondering if I am using a correct strategy. 

Thanks a lot,

To prevent this issue, we should do two things. First work on reporting: if @medcharleslaidi had been able to show us a report, we would have immediately diagnosed the problem. Second, we can add a warning in the mask extraction routines if they fail. It might prompt the user to look at their data. I have added #1276 as an enhancement issue on this subject.
