This pull request brings oauthlib up to date with its own docs for the [Resource Owner Password Credential Grant](https://oauthlib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/oauth2/grants/password.html) by allowing the `refresh_token` to be generated optionally.  Specifically:
- I added the keyword argument`refresh_token=True` to the `ResourceOwnerPasswordCredentialsGrant` to govern whether or not a `refresh_token` is generated
- Update the `ResourceOwnerPasswordCredentialsGrant` class's `__init__` docstring to reflect the change
- Add a corresponding test in `test_resource_owner_password.py`
