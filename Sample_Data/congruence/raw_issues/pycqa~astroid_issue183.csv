This is not very important, but it's worth a fix sometimes in the future. For the given example, Class.bool_value will return true, even though the class uses a metaclass which gives it a falsey value.

```
#!python

from astroid import parse
cls = parse('''
class Meta(type):
    def __len__(self):
       return 0

class C(metaclass=Meta):
    pass
''')['C']
print(cls.bool_value())
```
