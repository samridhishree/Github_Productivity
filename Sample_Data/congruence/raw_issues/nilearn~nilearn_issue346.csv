A simple example reproducing the problem:

``` python

from nilearn.image import resample_img
import numpy as np
from nibabel import Nifti1Image


def test(fourth_dim):
    shape_in = (64, 64, 64)
    aff_in = np.diag([2., 2., 2., 1.])
    aff_out = np.diag([3., 3., 3., 1.])
    data = np.ones(shape_in + (fourth_dim, ), dtype=np.float64)

    img_in = Nifti1Image(data, aff_in)

    img_out = resample_img(img_in,
                           target_affine=aff_out,
                           interpolation='nearest')

    print 'shape: ', img_out.shape

test(1024)  # works fine on my machine
test(1025)  # segmentation fault
```
