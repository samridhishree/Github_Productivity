Otherwise it throughs:

I think, this could be 1) tricky to newcomers and 2) requires incudling n=1 as a special case in script pipelines.

lead to creeping bugs that get unnoticed. We used to have such special
cases in scikit-learn and removed them based on a general feeling of the
dev team.

The proper fix would be a better error message that suggests what is
wrong and proposes the newaxis solution.
