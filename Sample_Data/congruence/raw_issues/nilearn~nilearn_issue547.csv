Can we add a function for plotting a connectivity matrix with the regions labels as the one in the example connectivity/plot_signal_extraction.html and with a colorbar ? I'm wondering if we can not put this function in _utils or plotting.

Probably in a new file.

"issue_comment","547","nilearn","nilearn","AlexandreAbraham","2016-08-02 09:47:53","This issue is talking about a connectivity matrix plotting function. Ie, a connectome. Another way to visualize it is with the circle diagrame like this:

Given that both are representation of a connectome, I think that we can put them altogether.

Also, the description states:

> Can we add a function for plotting **a connectivity matrix** with the regions labels

I am not against having a general matrix plotting function. I am just wondering if it is useful.
