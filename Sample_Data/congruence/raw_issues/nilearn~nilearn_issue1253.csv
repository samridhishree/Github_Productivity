I will try to have a look at some point tomorrow. Before that, Can you rebase onto master ? Test failure seems to be fixed recently.

Just asking to get some details, is there any discussion some where regarding this PR ?

Renaming is discussed in #1220.
Coordinates change to match precise reference is done to fix #1093 
Rois masks generation is in relation with #1246, not really solving it but somehow a temporary workaround

I thought it was important to visualize the spheric ROIs. All the other maskers take an ROIs file while the `NiftiSpheresMasker` creates its own ROIs that are in fact hidden.
For me visualizing my ROIs is important, for instance if there is an overlap I want to see it, also the difference between different radii, etc.
Also, I though it may be useful to demo the `coord_transform` function.
