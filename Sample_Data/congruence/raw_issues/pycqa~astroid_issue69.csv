When pylint checks the following source code:

```
#!python
def func(sequence):
    head, *tail = sequence
    return reversed(tail)
```

It will encounter this error in Astroid:

```
  File ""/usr/lib/python3.3/site-packages/astroid-1.3.2-py3.3.egg/astroid/inference.py"", line 366, in infer_ass
    stmts = list(self.assigned_stmts(context=context))
  File ""/usr/lib/python3.3/site-packages/astroid-1.3.2-py3.3.egg/astroid/protocols.py"", line 252, in assend_assigned_stmts
    return self.parent.assigned_stmts(self, context=context)
AttributeError: 'Starred' object has no attribute 'assigned_stmts'
```

The starred variable is clearly part of the trigger for this error, but there also seems to be something special about the 'reversed' function: for example 'len' does not trigger the error.

versions used:

```
pylint3 1.4.0, 
astroid 1.3.2, common 0.63.2
Python 3.3.5 (default, Mar 27 2014, 17:16:46) [GCC]
```

Jira is making a mess by removing line endings and {noformat} doesn't do anything... I'll put the text in an attachment as well.

_Edit:_ In Firefox I get a formatting toolbar which was missing in Rekonq for some reason; triple backtick does suppress auto-formatting.
