"issue_title","1118","nilearn","nilearn","MartinPerez","2016-06-09 23:25:48","In the nifti masker low pass and high pass can take a False value according to the documentation. But in signal.clean only float is allowed and in case False is passed it is considered as different from None and line 505 of signal.py is executed when it shouldnt. I was getting an error for passing False on both high and low pass and then putting tr to None which results in a division by None.

Does this make sense? Should the docs be updated and a Value error be raised whenever tr is none with any given value for high or low pass? I can make a PR if I am not wrong about this.

For example, I would do `git grep` masker family and then see if there is anything to be changed. Let me know if your not clear.
