- Fix a couple of typos;
- Change `X` to `fmri_masked` and `y` to `target`, for consistency (and allowing all the inlined code to be copied/pasted without any trouble);
- For the same reason, defining `n_conditions = len(set(target))` manually;
- In the beginning, before downloading the data, warning about the time and size required for fetching them;
- A `classification_accuracy` was displayed `1.000`, it is misleading as a 100% accuracy is almost never achievable;
- Update displayed signature of a sklearn.svm.SVC object (eps is now called tol, default cache_size is 200 Mb).","27171b3f2a921395cb110c9508d71a219282a3a5","","api.github.com,git_clone","[u'[""doc/decoding/decoding_tutorial.rst""]']","False","[]","[]","[]","[]"

This PR provides massively univariate linear models estimation using
OLS regression and permutation testing. The code is designed to
complete a very large number of permutations (> 100000) on a large
problem (thousands of targets variables, namely the brain voxels)
within a few minutes.
As compared to the v1 PR, we do not split the targets so as to perform
their analysis on parallel computing units, but we delegate a fraction
of permutations to the parallel computing units. This solves the
problem we had ensuring the data are permuted in the same manner by
each worker. The code is also simpler as the max F-score across data
descriptors can be computed directly after each permutation.
We assume that we perform analysis of a reasonable number of tested
variates and that each computing unit can process the target variates
without the need to split it. Typically, neuroimaging-genetic problems
(and particularly Genom-Wide Association Studies) require specific
code optimizations that are not straightwforward with the new design
proposed in this PR.","4996941ea3d4b34c3fd51707fd860010151e3c49","","api.github.com,git_clone","[u'[""nilearn/mass_univariate/tests/test_permuted_least_squares.py"", ""plot_haxby_mass_univariate.py"", ""nilearn/mass_univariate/permuted_least_squares.py""]']","False","[]","[]","[]","[]"

A test is failing on Travis (np.diff(objective) <= 0 in
test_group_sparse_covariance.py:51), that does not occur of the
developer's machine. np.diff(objective) may be hitting the numerical
noise floor (1e-14 or so). Some values may then be slightly positive.
This is most probably due to a different numerical library which leads to
a slightly different result.

The fix consists in decreasing the number of iterations so that optimization
stops before hitting the noise floor.","8647d78eff16492804d460e5666e91c9a8fb9ea5","","api.github.com,git_clone","[u'[""nilearn/tests/test_group_sparse_covariance.py""]']","False","[]","[]","[]","[]"

A test is failing on Travis (np.diff(objective) <= 0 in
test_group_sparse_covariance.py:51), that does not occur of the
developer's machine. np.diff(objective) may be hitting the numerical
noise floor (1e-14 or so). Some values may then be slightly positive.
This is most probably due to a different numerical library which leads to
a slightly different result.

The fix consists in decreasing the number of iterations so that optimization
stops before hitting the noise floor.","8647d78eff16492804d460e5666e91c9a8fb9ea5","","api.github.com","","False","[]","[]","[]","[]"

"pull_request_commit","167","nilearn","nilearn","VirgileFritsch","2014-02-21 16:44:32","NF: Add Massively Univariate Linear Model with permuted OLS (v2).

This PR provides massively univariate linear models estimation using
OLS regression and permutation testing. The code is designed to
complete a very large number of permutations (> 100000) on a large
problem (thousands of targets variables, namely the brain voxels)
within a few minutes.
As compared to the v1 PR, we do not split the targets so as to perform
their analysis on parallel computing units, but we delegate a fraction
of permutations to the parallel computing units. This solves the
problem we had ensuring the data are permuted in the same manner by
each worker. The code is also simpler as the max F-score across data
descriptors can be computed directly after each permutation.
We assume that we perform analysis of a reasonable number of tested
variates and that each computing unit can process the target variates
without the need to split it. Typically, neuroimaging-genetic problems
(and particularly Genom-Wide Association Studies) require specific
code optimizations that are not straightwforward with the new design
proposed in this PR.","4996941ea3d4b34c3fd51707fd860010151e3c49","","api.github.com","","False","[]","[]","[]","[]"

Careful timing / profiling shows that the dual-gap of the proximal
operator is sometimes decreased too far. As a result, the proximal
operator spends a lot of time trying to reach this dual gap, for no good
increase in overall energy. Profiling the code shows that this is the
number one loss of time.

Given that with warm-restart well implemented, decreasing on the fly the
tolerance of the proximal isn't very costly, we can rely fully on the
adaptative strategy, rather than on the paper of Schmidt et al (ie
implement FAASTA as in the paper). I have done this here. Printing values
of energies on the Haxby dataset shows that energy is decreased as well.

The code seems to be around 1.5 times faster.

I am sending a PR to see how this behaves on Travis / Circle","fb3d73e4c1c626379e84f11bc860e535b14531bc","","api.github.com","","False","[]","[]","[]","[]"
