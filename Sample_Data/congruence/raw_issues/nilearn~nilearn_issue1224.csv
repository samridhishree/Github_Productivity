To me, it's either reordering in the loader, or no reordering.

I am slightly leaning on the reordering, as it does make the matrices more structured, and that's useful for the examples and for teaching.

No, it just means that the example is much more readable when reordered

science that people will do with it.

Yes, but Dosenbach already provides networks and subgroups of regions with the same name in the csv, and it would be nice to benefit from this, no?

I tried to rewrite it in the style of the seed to voxels example (`plot_seed_based_correlations`), because I liked it a lot, it was written as a story. I learned a lot from this single example like the transformation from signals to images I was not aware of. But I don't know if other people feel the same.

I want to know if you agree with such changes, because I can rewrite that way connectivity examples I am working on.

You know what: if we stick to the principle that we'll use the covariance
estimators and not ConnectivityMeasure for single-subject analysis, than
we should use the GraphLassoCV and not ConnectivityMeasure. It is not
more complex to use the GraphLassoCV than to use LedoitWolf.

And there is a nice thing here, which is that for group studies, I would
recommend the LedoitWolf, as GraphLassoCV has instabilities that will
vary from subject to subject, however, for
single-subject, this clearly ilustrates that we should prefer
GraphLassoCV. So, if we teach people to use ConnectivityMeasure for group
analysis, and do things manually in the single subject case, it makes
sense.
