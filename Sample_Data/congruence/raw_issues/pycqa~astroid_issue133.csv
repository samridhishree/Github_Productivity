We should add a couple of base classes (or mixins) in astroid for exporting the type of capabilites a node can have. For instance, Callable needs to implement `infer_call_result`, Iterable needs to implement `itered`. Sequence needs to implement `getitem` and so on. This would be extremely helpful when adding new nodes, especially when adding new objects such as objects.Super or objects.FrozenSet.
