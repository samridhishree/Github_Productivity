The additional build is allowed to fail in Travis so there won't be any impact on build status and we can refine the flake8 checking after having learned how useful it is.

The problem comes from the fact that Travis checks out a single branch like this:

```
git clone --depth=50 --branch=test https://github.com/lesteve/nilearn.git lesteve/nilearn
```

So even doing `git fetch origin` upstream/master, origin/master is not going to show up in `git branch -r`.

The thing to bear in mind is that the Travis build that does the flake8 checks doesn't run tests so I would expect the unshallowing not to matter that much in practice.
