when the OAuth2 client receives a refresh_token from a grant, it [saves it on its own instance](https://github.com/idan/oauthlib/blob/master/oauthlib/oauth2/rfc6749/clients/base.py#L469).

[`prepare_refresh_token_request`](https://github.com/idan/oauthlib/blob/612ac5b0f606e689b86d6918884391cb8e07c060/oauthlib/oauth2/rfc6749/clients/base.py#L273-L302) completely ignores that, taking the refresh_token from the parameters passed in only.

This leads to having to write code like this:

```python
url, headers, body = self._client.prepare_refresh_token_request(
    self._settings.baseUrl + self._settings.accessTokenUri,
    client_id=self._settings.clientId,
    refresh_token=self_client.refresh_token
)
```

Why is that so?","start issue","OAuth2 Client does not use own refresh_token in prepare_refresh_token_request"
