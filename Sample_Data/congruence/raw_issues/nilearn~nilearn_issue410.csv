Thanks. Make sure to use a small map to avoid the test taking long.

One example of test that you can copy is:

What is happening here is that due to the fact that `vmax` is specified and `symmetric_cbar != 'auto'`, the function thinks it is not necessary to find maximum and minimum of the stat map, but these values are still used later on. Will fix this asap.
