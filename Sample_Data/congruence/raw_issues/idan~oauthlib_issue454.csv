If you run [this code snippet](https://gist.github.com/nderkach/663532a8ffc83b02b022b9672ecdc0fd) you can see that there is a mismatch between expected and actual calculated mac. The snippet is taken from the library code with a slight modification to disable generation of nonce and ts. Any idea what's wrong here?

**UPD**: I don't see any issues with oauthlib implementation of draft 1, so could that be that the error is in the spec itself?","start issue","Mac headers are calculated incorrectly for OAuth2"

You're looking at the first draft, but they got up to draft 5: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac-05","",""
