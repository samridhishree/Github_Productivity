The following code shows that if a member is not found in the current class, it will
be looked into the parent, even though the `__init__` was changed and the parent's **init** wasn't called.

```
#!python

from astroid.test_utils import extract_node
n = extract_node('''
class A(object):
   def __init__(self):
      self.value = 42
   def __add__(self, other):
      return other.value + self.value / 2
class B(A):
   def __init__(self):
      self.value1 = 24
   def __radd__(self, other):
      return NotImplemented
A() + B()
B().value
''')
print(repr(n))
inferred = next(n.infer())
print(next(inferred.igetattr('value')).value)

```
