http://nilearn.github.io/manipulating_visualizing/manipulating_images.html ). 

An option (eg used in scipy-lectures) is the expandable TOC, that expands one level to the current section:
http://www.scipy-lectures.org/intro/matplotlib/matplotlib.html
It's much more readable.

Other option: grab the full CSS and theme from scipy-lectures, which is overall much better (eg displays better on small devices, less cramped with more whitespace which relaxes the reading). It will however require adapting details like the color scheme. What do people think?

But there are many more improvement in the scikit-learn theme. So the
danger is to backport them one after the other.

It should be as simple as defining the non-active `li` parent node as hidden by default.

I see no big difference between the 2. One annoyance with the scipy lecture note website is the size of the fonts: on my laptop they look huge, on my phone, they look OK, except the ones in frames that at are so small that I need to zoom in. nilearn website looks OK on both devices. The only problem is that big images are sometimes out of the frame on my phone, which is not a big deal IMHO.
