## Tests

I've written tests and added the *streams* Redis branch to the travis config. In theory, the tests will only be run when the streams branch is available. ~~The logic is a bit hacky, but I figured it will only be until streams makes it into 4.0~~ (now improved as the hacky version didn't actually work).

## Style

I'm very open to feedback on my implementation style for the new commands. I've tried to stick to the aioredis style, but I think I will have probably wandered here or there. Happy to make any corrections or alterations.

## Reason

This is my first time using aioredis. I'm working on [another project] in(https://github.com/adamcharnock/lightbus) which I would like to experiment with Redis streams, plus I also need asyncio support. I therefore thought I'd contribute this here.

As I said, happy to make any changes etc.

## Remaining work

- [ ] Add support for the ``MAXLEN`` parameter in ``xadd()``
- [ ] There is a question regarding style in the source for ``xread()``","start issue","Adding XADD/XRANGE/XREAD stream commands"
