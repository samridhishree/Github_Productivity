"issue_comment","6","idan","oauthlib","dgouldin","2012-03-15 16:00:23","@ib-lundgren good catch, but I'd rather you pair the scheme with the port since it is possible for somebody to use 80 for https or 443 for http:

```
if (scheme == u'http' and port == u'80') or (scheme == u'https' and port == u'443'):
```

Good idea @dgouldin , have updated to match your suggestion. Am a bit uncertain where to put the defaults port in the code though... in the method (as it is now)? inside the if u':'  block? or on top level as a constant DEFAULT_PORTS?
