"pull_request_commit_comment","14","aio-libs","aioredis","popravich","2014-06-17 20:52:48","Everything looks good.
But I would prefer `*values` split into two vars: `value, *values`
This would be more verbose when looking on function signature,
ie: `def pfadd(self, key, value, *values)` -- it's clear that at least on `value` is required and others are optional.
Same note regarding `pfcount` and `pfmerge`.
