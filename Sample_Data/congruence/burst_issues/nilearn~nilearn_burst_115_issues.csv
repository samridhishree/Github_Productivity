I stumbled across nilearn a few days ago. Great tool and a teriffic way to harness the power of sklearn. Thanks!
Now, I'm trying to get all voxel values from a structural MRI (VBM) image for every ROI in a given atlas. What I would like to get out is one np array for every ROI (or a list of arrays or whatever works). After trying for an hour with NiftiMasker, NiftiLabelsMasker, and NiftiMapsMasker, it seems as though nilearn 
1) can only take 4d images (LabelsMasker and MapsMasker)
or 2) cannot handle the atlas format used in the Nilearn (... datasets.fetch_atlas...).
For example, NiftiMasker takes binary masks without a problem, however, I would have to convert every single ROI from Nilearn's own AAL atlas to be able to use NiftiMasker to extract all ROIs in an atlas, it seems. On the other hand, LabelsMasker and MapsMasker appear to be able to handle Nilearn atlas formats, but do not support extracting voxel data from 3d (i.e. non-resting-state, structural) images. 
Could you please give me a hint on how to solve this? I'm sure I'm overlooking something very simple that would enable using the Nilearn atlases for data extraction in 3d images.
Thanks in advance. Cheers,
Tim

For me, I didn't get your question. plot_connectome does plots connectivity matrices on a glass brain.

Do you have any example to show what you meant by using seaborn color libraries ?",,
4,issue_comment,1492,nilearn,nilearn,KamalakerDadi,2017-08-18 17:21:02,">In other words, I wish to be able to simply do something like the following instead:

I am afraid there is no straightforward to do what you are asking.
One thing you could try.

```python
connectome = plotting.plot_connectome(conn_matrixA, coordsA,
                                      edge_threshold=99%, node_color='red')
connectome.add_graph()
```
To know how to use ```add_graph```, you can have a look at plot_connectome plotting function code.
Hope this helps.

Good that it worked for you. Closing this one then.",,
6,issue_comment,1492,nilearn,nilearn,dpisner453,2017-08-18 15:22:15,"Sure, what I want to avoid is having to do this:

```
##where membership_plotting here is a 2-column array of coordinates and categories of membership to different communities
n = len(membership_plotting.unique())
clust_pal = sns.color_palette(""Set2"", n)
clust_lut = dict(zip(map(str, np.unique(membership_plotting.astype('category'))), clust_pal))
clust_colors = colors.to_rgba_array(membership_plotting.map(clust_lut))
plotting.plot_connectome(conn_matrix, coords, node_color = clust_colors, edge_threshold=edge_threshold, node_size=20, colorbar=True)
```

In other words, I wish to be able to simply do something like the following instead:
```
connectome = plotting.plot_connectome(conn_matrixA, coordsA, edge_threshold=99%, node_color='red')
connectome.add_overlay_connectome(conn_matrixB, coordsB, edge_threshold=99%, node_color='blue')
##Where the latter function 'add_overlay_connectome' does not exist in nilearn
```

How can I easily go about overlaying to different connectome plot on the same glass brain? Maybe there is a straightforward way to do this already that I'm just not aware of in nilearn?

Hopefully my question makes a bit more sense now :-/",,
