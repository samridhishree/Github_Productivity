I was trying to use oauthlib by the code below. 

``` python
oauth = oauthlib.oauth2.draft25.Server('code')
verified = oauth.verify_request(uri = self.request.uri, http_method = 'GET', body = None, headers = self.request.headers)
```

But I got an error: object has no attribute '_tokens'.
As I thought, using 'class Server(AuthorizationEndpoint, TokenEndpoint, ResourceEndpoint):' may only allows the `__init__` of AuthorizationEndpoint works. So there is no initation for ResourceEndpoint either no _tokens.

So I added the code below.

``` python
oauth._tokens = {'Bearer': oauthlib.oauth2.draft25.tokens.BearerToken()}
oauth._default_token_type = 'Bearer'
```

Then got an error: AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'estimate_type'.
So I am confusing now.

Am I wrong or this part of oauthlib is not completed yet?

Thanks for your work.

Regards,
Evlos
