I think one thing we should look at doing soon is a new PyPI release (#346). Anyone fancy writing up a change list? I'll push once we have one. 

As always, if you have a question, would like to discuss something or simply draw my attention somewhere feel free email/hangouts msg me at ib.lundgren@gmail.com. 

p.s. If you would like to become a contributor please get in touch. In this round I included people from this thread but there are many more who have made great contributions in the past. If you are one of those please do not be offended but rather sent me an email :)
