There needs to be a short and sweet collection of common problems and their solutions. Short solutions could simply be inlined and longer linked to...
- Do you support XYZ? See #117
- What is an OAuth client?
- (Client) Connecting to various common services like Google, Facebook, Twitter
- OAuth 1) What is a client_key, client_secret, etc
- OAuth 2) What is a client_id, scope, state, etc
- What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
- How do I secure my users and API using OAuth?
- What is an OAuth provider?
- In a nutshell, what is the difference between OAuth 1 & 2?
- Some argue OAuth 2 is worse than 1, is that true?
- When to use OAuth 1 and 2 (#118).
- How to get started on an OAuth 1 provider
- How to get started on an OAuth 2 provider
  ...

Please add more suggestions =)

"issue_comment","119","idan","oauthlib","wiliamsouza","2013-02-18 19:40:25","""How to get started on an OAuth 2 provider"" That is a good question in nutshell It can be basicaly, I implement the methods  of oauthlib.oauth2.RequestValidator and pass it to oauthlib.oauth2.WebApplicationServer so I can call create_authorization_response and  create_token_response?

"issue_comment","119","idan","oauthlib","ib-lundgren","2013-02-18 20:03:32","Essentially. yes. Note that while OAuth 2 providers are quickly maturing they are still not quite ready for prime time and there might lurk nasty bugs there.

Check out https://oauthlib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/server2.html for some info as well.
