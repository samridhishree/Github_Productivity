Not sure if it's ok for you.

The error is : `SyntaxError: encoding declaration in Unicode string`

This is due to the fact that `version.py` starts with an encoding declaration `# *- encoding: utf-8 -*-`. No idea how to solve this though.

We could remove the first line on python 3, or add it dynamically for python 2, but neither sound great.
