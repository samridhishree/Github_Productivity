There's a very good reference on how the dot access works, for classes, instances and metaclasses (http://blog.ionelmc.ro/2015/02/09/understanding-python-metaclasses/). 
It would be nice if Class.getattr would behave similarly, meaning that its return value should respect mro at least (it currently doesn't do this). This could fix a couple of false positives in pylint (https://bitbucket.org/logilab/pylint/issue/354/cannot-infer-constructor-arguments-with might be an example of this)
