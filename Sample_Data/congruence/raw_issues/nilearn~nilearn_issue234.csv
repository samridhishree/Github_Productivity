Typically, the following code (in slicers.OrthoSlicer.find_cut_coords):

<pre>
                x_map, y_map, z_map = find_xyz_cut_coords(img.get_data(),
                                        activation_threshold=threshold)
                cut_coords = coord_transform(x_map, y_map, z_map,
                                             img.get_affine())
</pre>

would be rewritten as only one function call.
