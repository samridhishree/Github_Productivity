The next step, I think, would be to estimate connectivity directly from img. One way to do this is to have an object that takes one or two maskers and estimate the connectivity matrix between them (if one masker, estimate the connectivtiy of the extracted timeseries against themselves).

With this simple scheme, people will be able to easily do seed to ROI or ROI to voxel or ROI to ROI connectivity. Plus, if we use iterators, we can do this efficiently in memory. I think that could become a killer feature for nilearn and that shows how to leverage the maskers' power.

In order not hasten design, I'd rather finish the experiments with the
object of Kamalakar, and draw experience from it first.

Yes, I did not think of augmenting the ConnectivityMeasure class but adding a new one.

I know but what I had in mind is inbetween his work and what we have now. Plus, it has to be a specific object to be able to do it ""online"". Kamalakar could then re-use it in his work.

What might be missing currently be maskers memory consumption (particularly ), labels and maps maskers not accepting list of subjects and non-parallelization and confounds cleaning in Connectivity Measure. Apart from that, the object design idea looks really interesting.

Can you elaborate on this please ? What is inbetween I am not able to strike and online ?
