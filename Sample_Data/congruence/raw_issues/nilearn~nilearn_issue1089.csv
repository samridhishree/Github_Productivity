However, it's a very light modification and it makes the code work like the user expects it: asking the user to do fit(['fmri.nii']) is not good. In addition, the current error

In the long run, maybe we should think about this in the same time as when we do the globbiing.

I have made sure that strings are well handle (as per @AlexandreAbraham 's remark).

For example, with imgs=""test.nii"", this will not work as strings are iterable. And I'm sure that we can find other weird cases. This is why NiftiStuffMasker are declined in Single and Multi flavors: accepting any dimensionality of data was too messy.

Plus documentation is not updated.

I would go for feeding ['test.nii'] to canica for single subject and postponing this behavior for later when we will have time to think it through. Apart from that, +1 for merge.
