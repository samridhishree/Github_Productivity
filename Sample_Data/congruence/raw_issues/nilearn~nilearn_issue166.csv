Using this function on an anat file I would like to crop didn't work as well as it should due to very small nonzero values outside the brain which impede the cropper from cropping closer. A relative threshold of 10^-15 \* np.abs(img.get_data()).max() instead of exact zero should solve the problem, but the question is whether this functionality is wanted.

No, this sounds perfectly reasonnable.
