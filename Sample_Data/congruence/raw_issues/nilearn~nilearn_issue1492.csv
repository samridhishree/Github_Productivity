For me, I didn't get your question. plot_connectome does plots connectivity matrices on a glass brain.

Do you have any example to show what you meant by using seaborn color libraries ?","",""

I am afraid there is no straightforward to do what you are asking.
One thing you could try.

```python
connectome = plotting.plot_connectome(conn_matrixA, coordsA,
                                      edge_threshold=99%, node_color='red')
connectome.add_graph()
```
To know how to use ```add_graph```, you can have a look at plot_connectome plotting function code.
Hope this helps.

Good that it worked for you. Closing this one then.","",""
"issue_comment","1492","nilearn","nilearn","dpisner453","2017-08-18 15:22:15","Sure, what I want to avoid is having to do this:

```
##where membership_plotting here is a 2-column array of coordinates and categories of membership to different communities
n = len(membership_plotting.unique())
clust_pal = sns.color_palette(""Set2"", n)
clust_lut = dict(zip(map(str, np.unique(membership_plotting.astype('category'))), clust_pal))
clust_colors = colors.to_rgba_array(membership_plotting.map(clust_lut))
plotting.plot_connectome(conn_matrix, coords, node_color = clust_colors, edge_threshold=edge_threshold, node_size=20, colorbar=True)
```

In other words, I wish to be able to simply do something like the following instead:
```
connectome = plotting.plot_connectome(conn_matrixA, coordsA, edge_threshold=99%, node_color='red')
connectome.add_overlay_connectome(conn_matrixB, coordsB, edge_threshold=99%, node_color='blue')
##Where the latter function 'add_overlay_connectome' does not exist in nilearn
```

How can I easily go about overlaying to different connectome plot on the same glass brain? Maybe there is a straightforward way to do this already that I'm just not aware of in nilearn?

Hopefully my question makes a bit more sense now :-/","",""
