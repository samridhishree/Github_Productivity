There needs to be a short and sweet collection of common problems and their solutions. Short solutions could simply be inlined and longer linked to...
- Do you support XYZ? See #117
- What is an OAuth client?
- (Client) Connecting to various common services like Google, Facebook, Twitter
- OAuth 1) What is a client_key, client_secret, etc
- OAuth 2) What is a client_id, scope, state, etc
- What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
- How do I secure my users and API using OAuth?
- What is an OAuth provider?
- In a nutshell, what is the difference between OAuth 1 & 2?
- Some argue OAuth 2 is worse than 1, is that true?
- When to use OAuth 1 and 2 (#118).
- How to get started on an OAuth 1 provider
- How to get started on an OAuth 2 provider

Please add more suggestions =)

oauth library depends on pycrypto library which is not pure Python library (has some c extensions). For this reason pycrypto can't be installed from source on Windows without Visual Studio 2008 installed (needed to compile these c extensions of pycrypto). The simplest solution is to download binary installers and install them using easy_install (pip doesn't support installing of binaries). 32bit binary installers for Python 2.2-2.7 and 64bit binary installer for Python 2.6 are at [The Voidspace Python Modules](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/modules.shtml#pycrypto) and 64bit binary installer for Python 2.7 is at [Compiling pycrypto on Win7-64](http://yorickdowne.wordpress.com/2010/12/22/compiling-pycrypto-on-win7-64/). Binary installers can be installed in virtualenv - see http://stackoverflow.com/q/3271590/95735

We should provide a guidance document to help prospective OAuth providers choose what they should support to best cater to their target clients. 

For example,
- Unable to use SSL? Use OAuth 1
- Require Holder of Key (link) right now? Use OAuth 1
- Your target client is a
  - javascript or mobile application? Use OAuth 2 Implicit Grant (MobileApplicationServer)
  - web app (i.e. lives on the web server)? Use OAuth 2 Authorization Code Grant (WebApplicationServer)
  - web application moving away from directly using the users username and password to using OAuth 2 tokens but unable to switch to only use tokens because of legacy dependencies? Use OAuth 2 Resource Owner Password Credentials grant (LegacyApplicationServer)
  - trusted backend job working on user data but not interacting with a user? Use OAuth 2 Client Credentials grant (BackendApplicationServer)
- Need to support dynamic client registration? Use OAuth 2 (more on this in #109)
