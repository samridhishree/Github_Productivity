What do you mean? I think that '0' would be less surprising than '.0',
and that I shouldn't have used '.0' here. But what do you mean by '1' (or
1.) here?

That's what I meant: 0 or 0. i.e with the dot ~~before~~ **after** might be less confusing than .0 (dot ~~after~~ **before** the 0)

For the record, this is a markdown gotcha (that I already bumped into recently actually). Starts a line with a 0. and it will be interpreted as a numbered list and replace by 1.

Agreed. Give me 10mn (I am on something else) and I'll fix this.

But that's not the point of this example. I'd rather keep only one idea
per example

That' not completely true, as it doesn't apply to all functions. I have
added a comment on plot_roi, though.
