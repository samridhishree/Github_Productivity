1. update pylint.
2. run pylint on a python project
3. get traceback :/

### Current behavior
```

  File ""/usr/bin/pylint"", line 11, in <module>
    sys.exit(run_pylint())
  File ""/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pylint/__init__.py"", line 12, in run_pylint

    Load = _Context.Load
AttributeError: 'Enum' object has no attribute 'Load'
