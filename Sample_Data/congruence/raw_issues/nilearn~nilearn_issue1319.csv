"issue_title","1319","nilearn","nilearn","pbellec","2016-10-27 15:21:59","A number of issues were raised with the COBRE preprocessed dataset since its integration:
- First and foremost, the dataset was too big (8 GB)
- Too many steps of the preprocessing had been fixed (""scrubbing"", regression of certain confounds, etc) while this could be done easily with nilearn
- also there were some discrepancies between the ids used to name the files and the ids used in the public phenotypic data

I have prepared a new figshare release that addresses these issues:
- fMRI data is now resampled at 6 mm isotropic and encoded with 16 bit integers. Size has dropped to 620 MB.
- Data is now released with minimal preprocessing (motion correction, BOLD-T1, T1-template registration, no smoothing, no regression of confounds, no scrubbing). A spreadsheet (gzipped tabular-separated values) is released for each fMRI dataset, with a fairly comprehensive list of confounds. Those can be grabbed to run regression/scrubbing in nilearn, although some of these operations can also be done independently using nilearn tools. 
- Data come with a consolidated phenotypic_data.tsv.gz file. It includes demographics and diagnostic data, as well as measures of motion with/without scrubbing, that can be used to filter the subjects or match patients/controls based on motion levels. 

The confounds and phenotypic data are described in two separate json files. The files as well as a markdown description of the dataset (README.md) are available here https://figshare.com/articles/COBRE_preprocessed_with_NIAK_0_17_-_lightweight_release/4106844

Note that the registration of all volumes have been checked visually. An interactive report (including registration and motion) is available here

@KamalakerDadi could you update the cobre fetcher and companion tutorial?

+1! Pretty awesome.

I'd like to change all our example to use COBRE rather than ABIDE at some
point, as the prediction of phenotype actually somewhat works on COBRE.

"issue_comment","1319","nilearn","nilearn","pbellec","2016-10-28 00:38:05","I should have double checked the release. Althgouh all files are listed, with the correct size, the download links are broken. I probably messed up with their upload API. I've contacted figshare support, will let you know when it works.

"issue_comment","1319","nilearn","nilearn","pbellec","2016-11-03 00:52:07","So this took me much more time than I would have liked, but I finally figured out their API. The collection is now stored here: https://figshare.com/articles/COBRE_preprocessed_with_NIAK_0_17_-_lightweight_release/4197885 I checked and the ""download all"" works, and files are identical to what I uploaded. So I think it's now ready to go, sorry about the hicup. FYI over my university network I had download  speeds of 500k-1M/sec, so it took a good 15 mns to download the whole collection of ~150 subjects.

It would be helpful.
Could you please also update keys_phenotypic_data.json and keys_confounds.json.
