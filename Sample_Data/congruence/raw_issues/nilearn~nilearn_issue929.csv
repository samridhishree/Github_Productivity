using nilearn on OSX El Capitan, when executing the example scripts like plot_demo_glass_brain.py no plots will show up. PiP and iPython linked to the same folders, matplotlib alone does show plots. All dependencies are up-to-date and installed. Don't really know how to fix this.

``` python

this is the canonical way to detect OSX.

How do you get matplotlib to show plots?
