There's a new version of [async-timeout](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/async-timeout) available.
You are currently using **1.2.1**. I have updated it to **1.4.0**



These links might come in handy:  <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/async-timeout"">PyPI</a> | <a href=""https://pyup.io/changelogs/async-timeout/"">Changelog</a> | <a href=""https://github.com/aio-libs/async_timeout/"">Repo</a> 



### Changelog
> 
>### 1.4.0

>------------------

>* Implement `remaining` property (20)

>  * If timeout is not started yet or started unconstrained:
>    `remaining` is `None`
>  * If timeout is expired: `remaining` is `0.0`
>  * All others: roughly amount of time before `TimeoutError` is triggered



>### 1.3.0

>------------------

>* Don&#39;t suppress nested exception on timeout. Exception context points
>  on cancelled line with suspended `await` (13)

>* Introduce `.timeout` property (16)

>* Add methods for using as async context manager (9)
