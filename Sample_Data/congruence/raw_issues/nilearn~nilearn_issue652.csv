So it looks like lexicographical ordering first in the first entry of the tuples, then the second, etc, so hierarchical lexicographical ordering. Now I know what it does, fine with me, but for comprehension, it may have been better to put

``` python
atlas_names = sorted(atlases.keys())
for name in atlas_names:
    atlas = atlases[name]
    ...
