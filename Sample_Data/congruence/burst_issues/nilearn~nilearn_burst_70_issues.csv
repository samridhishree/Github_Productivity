A few comments:
- the issue was talking about moving around the examples but you moved also some of the documentation, e.g. plotting.rst got moved from doc/manipulating_visualizing to doc/plotting manipulating_images.rst got moved from doc/manipulating_visualizing to manipulating_images. Not sure whether the generated HTML looks any different. If it doesn't that's probably fine.
- Someone should double-check once CircleCI that the breakdown of the examples by category makes sense. In particular what went into the ""Advanced"" section. Here is a comment from @GaelVaroquaux from the associated issue in case it helps:

66,pull_request_commit_comment,806,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2015-11-16 09:38:36,"Several problems in your function:
- you have 2 `for` loops: one to fetch the files, one to load them. They can be merged.
- you have 3 for loops intricated for the 3 parameters. You can factorize that using itertools
- you generate a string for each item of the dataset. That mean that, if I want to have the matrices of dimensionality 20, I'll have to parse your string, which is inconvenient, you can use 3 lists instead.
- there is no reason to call `_fetch_files` several times since you only download one file

So I would write:

``` python
    dataset_name = 'Megatrawls'
    data_dir = _get_dataset_dir(dataset_name, data_dir=data_dir, verbose=verbose)
    description = _get_dataset_descr(dataset_name)

    # Generate all combinations
    dims, tseries, mats = list(zip(*list(itertools.product(dimensionalities, timeseries, matrices))))
    files = []
    ts_map = dict(multiple_spatial_regression='ts2', eigen_regression='ts3')
    mat_map = dict(correlation='Znet1.txt', partial_correlation='Znet2.txt')
    for dim, tserie, mat in zip(dims, tseries, mats):
        filepath = os.path.join('3T_Q1-Q6related468_MSMsulc_d%d_%s' % (dim, ts_map[tserie]), mat_map[mat])
        files.append((filepath, url, opts))

    # Fetch all files
    files = _fetch_files(data_dir, files, resume=resume, verbose=verbose)

    # Load them
    files = [csv_to_array(f) for f in files]

    # Build the output bunch
    return Bunch(
        description=description,
        dimensionality=dims,
        timeseries=tseries,
        matrices=mats,
        data=files)
```

A good thing can also be to replace the `data` element by `correlation` and `partial_correlation` or both when pertinent.

``` python
    dummy = open(os.path.join(ho_dir, 'HarvardOxford-Cortical.xml'), 'w')
    dummy.write(""<?xml version='1.0' encoding='us-ascii'?> ""

The problem is that your dummy file must be loadable by `csv_to_array` and empty files are not. You can, for exemple, replace the call of `csv_to_array` by `np.gen_from_txt` directly. You can also determine the filepaths that will be loaded by the function and make them non empty:

``` python
    for dim in [25, 100, 200, 300]:

I suggest a new breakdown of examples:
- General: just a handful of examples
- Decoding: what we currently have
- Functional connectivity: what we currently have
- Plotting
- Manipulation of brain images
- Advanced

Basically, it would entail breaking up our current 'visualizing_and_manipulating' into 'plotting', 'manipulating' and 'advanced'. Advanced is just another word for 'other', in a certain sense. We would put things like the low-level ICA stuff, or the mass-univariate stuff. Ie things that we don't really want to advertise strong to end users.

One strong reason for me to separate out the plotting examples is that it seems that our users do not use the full breadth of the plotting options, and do not find them.

This is an issue labelled 'discussion', please do comment here on what you think about this plan.

I think that the best way to compute correlations with LedoitWolf is to standardize the time series first. The reasoning being that LedoitWolf strives to give the best estimate (minimize a risk) of the covariance matrix. If what we want are correlations, we want the best estimate of the covariance of the standardized data.

By the way, such a difference will be also present with something like a GraphLasso for the estimator.

Hence, I would add in the ConnectivityMeasure transformer a test that normalizes time-series before running the covariance estimator if kind==""correlations"".

I have another suggestion (not for your PR, in general). In nilearn, we often use weird coding patterns (I'm thinking of taking the sum of a numpy array to know if there is nan inside for example). It would be interesting to keep a performance test (time and memory usage) for some of these patterns.

It is useful for other developers and, for example, we could bench the Nifti1Image format, on which we rely heavily, and thus spot if there is performance regression.

Benching the I/O is also interesting for cluster computation: some design patterns may not be favorable on a cluster because of longer file access time.

This is not a trivial work. What do you think?

For computation time testing, it's difficult because it depends on the speed of the cpu running the test. Using reference measures computed from the current master and stored in a dedicated file, we could compare the measures of a PR against them and raise an error in case of a too large difference.

I see the point. I don't how one can check the underlying I/O system calls from Python.
Maybe this could be done using a call to an external command like (only available on posix):

``` bash
# Return the number of system calls to read
strace python -c ""some python code with I/O"" 2>&1 | grep read | wc -l
# Return the number of system calls to write
strace python -c ""some python code with I/O"" 2>&1 | grep write | wc -l
```

The output of the commands above could then be sent back to and analyzed be the global python test script.

> This is not a trivial work.

I agree, but it's not impossible.

scikit-learn tried to do these kind of performance monitoring at one point during a GSoC. From what I have heard, a significant amount of time was invested with little return because this is a lot of work to maintain the infrastructure to do it. From what I remember it was based on vbench which ended up changing its internals and breaking the work that was done on scikit-learn.

I should work on my impression of converging then :-). Given the %memit behaviour we saw, I would feel a lot more confident to check that the memory usage is not smaller than 10 MiB. You may need to change your test to make sure that the function uses some memory for example by creating the array inside the function if you want to make sure that something doesn't make any copy, e.g. in your test_iter_niimg stuff but that sounds fine to me.

I do it. However, a masked seed is not a showstopper for me: the rest of the sphere can contain unmasked voxels.

The tests actually seem to run fine with the output:

I have seen that happening from time to time, but it tends to go away if you kick off another AppVeyor build.

Aggregating data, such as doing `sum` on all elements, is done faster than a test on each element. So, if we assume that most images will not have NaNs, this actually saves time.

+1 for copying only if there is no NaNs.

Any change on CSS needs to be validated thoroughly, as it affects the
whole documentation. These things are tricky.

Backporting some CSS from scipy-lectures to nilearn would probably fix
this, as a lot of effort went into designing a very good CSS for the code
block in scipy-lectures. But this is a certain amount of work.

For the record that was meant as a tongue in cheek comment. IIRC most datasets in nilearn need to be downloaded the first time. The poor modern neuroscience hacker without an internet connection is slightly out of luck I am afraid, unless of course he has downloaded the dataset already.

I am having a small issue working on these AAL2 files though. The voxel values in the .txt labels file don't match the voxel values. The voxel values have a '01' or '02' ""appended"" to them depending if it is left or right hemisphere. Does this sound familiar to you?

On the other hand, my boss says that AAL is not very precise (I'm not the physician to argue), in fact I will be using the Hammer atlas instead. This is from http://www.brain-development.org/
AFAIK adding this to nilearn requires a license acceptance though.

Yes, it's horrible. We have it because it is standard.

:(

It's thus probably not possible to have it, unless they are willing to do
a specific arrangement.

It would be fantastic if you would contact them. We can put a note in the
documentation stipulating the conditions of use. We cannot put something
where there is an action from the user, as things need to be able to run
without user intervention, eg on clusters.

1,issue_title,931,nilearn,nilearn,KamalakerDadi,2016-01-07 09:24:44,"As per the latest release 1.5.0 matplotlib, taking zero in upper or lower level, simply ignores the masking values for colormap matplotlib contour fillings. As you can reproduce using this snippet:

``` python
from nilearn import datasets
from nilearn import plotting

atlas = datasets.fetch_atlas_msdl()
plotting.plot_prob_atlas(atlas.maps, view_type='filled_contours', display_mode='z', cut_coords=1)

Here is a fix, I think:
Following discussions from https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/5477,
contour fillings levels should be given as (lower, upper) and what we need I believe in our case is that we force to append each upper level to `inf` to be well adapted to new code release with matplotlib. Correct me if I miss something in the discussion.

We can resume to normal mode by forcing upper level always to infinity at Line 543 in `displays.py`. 
`levels.append(0.)` to `levels.append(numpy.inf)` for this type of problem.

It works because of a bug in matplotlib with decreasing values. The contour code has changed in 1.5 and now giving non increasing list of levels yields an unexpected behavior (the actual Picasso painting at the top of this issue). So the proposition of Kamalakar makes the code compliant with matplotlib and solves the problem for 1.5 without impacting the behavior in previous versions.

@KamalakerDadi if you a PR, it will be merged ASAP.
