At the moment, Instance is used for instances of classes and instances of other built-in types (lists, dicts) are subclasses of it.  This leads to cases where code has to type-test using type identity rather than isinstance, for instance, and makes it impossible to customize the behavior of class instances.  Instance should probably be a superclass, containing code common to all instances, and ClassInstance should be a subclass.  This will probably also make it easier to subclass Instance to build code for other types coded in C.

Yes, this sounds good to me.

Separate class instances and builtin instances into two concepts

One problem with handling both concepts with a single class leads
to type-testing using type identity rather than using isinstance, since
builtin instances uses the same base class as class instances (even though
this is fairly fuzzy). With two classes instead, we can easily distinguish
between these cases.

The commit includes two new virtual base classes, Instance and BuiltinInstance
and separates the Instance class into BaseInstance and Instance, also
changing in some places the use of type-identity testing with isinstance testing.
Closes issue #214.

This should be fixed, but the solution is somewhat temporary. I don't like that BaseInstance has the entire lookup mechanism, but that will be changed when the lookup will be improved in #93.
