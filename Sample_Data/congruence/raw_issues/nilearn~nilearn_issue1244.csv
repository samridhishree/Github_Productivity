Probably I'm doing something wrong (different versions or so ?):

I'm investigating what I can do with Jupyter notebooks and came across some very nice looking notebooks from NiLearn, As I'm both new to Jupyter en NiLearn, this combination seems to be too difficult.

Already in the second code window< i ran into a bug: I had to change the last line

from nilearn import datasets, plotting
atlas_img = datasets.fetch_atlas_harvard_oxford('cort-maxprob-thr25-2mm')
# plotting.plot_roi ( atlas_img)

plotting.plot_roi ( atlas_img.maps )

The third code block contains at leat 2 erros, the first (masker=..), I solved but the second I'm lost (because indeed I can't find any file ""Background"".

from nilearn.input_data import NiftiLabelsMasker
# masker = NiftiLabelsMasker(labels_img=atlas_img)

masker = NiftiLabelsMasker(labels_img=atlas_img.labels )
# Now get the ADHD data

data = datasets.fetch_adhd(n_subjects=1)
# And apply the masker to the functional data

time_series = masker.fit_transform(data.func[0])

---

ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

Looks like I need to delete this repo :).

This is why I don't like any tutorial not in our continuous integration
:).

@Stef-aap: please use the notebooks shipped on the nilearn website. They
are tested.

it took me some time to find the source:
https://github.com/GaelVaroquaux/nilearn_course/blob/master/notebooks/2_signal_extraction_for_connectomes.ipynb

And I found that through:
https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks

ok, I now found:
http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/index.html
those examples seems to work.

thanks,
Stef
