### My environment:
- changelist: 3d97b83019b122288d7d2f561993ca6f907c6a47
- ubuntu 14.04 x64
- python 3.5.1
- redis 2.8.4 x64
### tests.pubsub_commands_test.PubSubCommandsTest

pubsub_numsub() method from PubSubCommandsMixin class returns byte instead of integer.

``` bash
AssertionError: {b'chan:1': b'0'} != {b'chan:1': 0}
- {b'chan:1': b'0'}
?             -- -
+ {b'chan:1': 0}
```
### tests.generic_commands_test.GenericCommandsTest.test_object_idletime

This test passes when run individually.

``` bash
python -m unittest tests.generic_commands_test.GenericCommandsTest.test_object_idletime
```

But fails when run with `make test`

``` python
yield from asyncio.sleep(1, loop=self.loop)
res = yield from self.redis.object_idletime('foo')
self.assertGreaterEqual(res, 1)
```

Increasing sleep time to 2 ensures pass.

Perhaps, above tests should be skipped at higher version than 2.8.0.
