I don't know if it is better to change the ROIs order in the csv file or reorder them in examples.

I'd rather reorder them in them CSV.

However, I think that changing this silently is a bit dangerous.

We could add an option to the loader, and warn that in 1 release the
default will change and the non reordered version will disappear.

That said, I don't find the reordered matrix much more structured. If you
add more subjects/data does it become more structured?

I also prefer this way

Yes

Generally speaking, dosenbach connectivity matrices are well structured. The first matrix does not even respect the networks
