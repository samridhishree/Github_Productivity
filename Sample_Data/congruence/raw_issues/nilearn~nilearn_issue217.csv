There is more to it: the number of detections has significantly dropped.

Could it be something related to the fact that a t-test is signed and not
an F-test. For instance in a max-stats correction procedure, the max
should be taken on the abs of the statistic. Also, when thresholding, the
threshold is applied on the abs of the statistic.

Good job!
