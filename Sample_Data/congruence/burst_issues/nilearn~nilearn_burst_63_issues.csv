I think that skl has the concept of ""real life examples"", which are clearly different from the vanilla ones. We should probably follow this distinction and put your in a different place.

There is no 'policy', I am afraid. It's more a question of 'design'. The
way I think of it is that nilearn needs to be as accessible as possible
(my visit to Oxford convinced me even more of this) and for this we need
to expose only high-level functionnality that is understandable and
useable to end users doing neuroimaging.
