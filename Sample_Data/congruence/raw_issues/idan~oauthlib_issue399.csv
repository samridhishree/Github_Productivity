or maybe oauth1 have another option to make connection in non https ? for development only of cource

oauth1

``` python
@property
def enforce_ssl(self):
    return True
```

oauth2

``` python
def is_secure_transport(uri):
    """"""Check if the uri is over ssl.""""""
    if os.environ.get('OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT'):
        return True
    return uri.lower().startswith('https://')
