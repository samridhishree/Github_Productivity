1. Run `pip install pylint pylint-mccabe`.
2. Run `pylint --load-plugins=pylint_mccabe` on any Python file.

Downgrading astroid to 1.5.3 fixes the problem. Sorry if I'm filing this in the wrong place, but it does appear that astroid made an unexpected backwards incompatible change when going to 1.6.0.","start issue","1.6.0 breaks pylint-mccabe"

As pylint-mccabe hasn't been updated in five years, you should probably move to this extension.

I just added the following to .pylintrc:
