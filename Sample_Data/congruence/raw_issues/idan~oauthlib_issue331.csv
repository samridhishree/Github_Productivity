request to sign has a body. If it's not the case a ValueError was raised
saying Content-Type was missing, while it actually could just be wrongly
set (e.g. to application/json). Fix the error message to reflect the
real problem: expected & given Content-Type.

Note that I couldn't run the tests locally: I get multiple errors no matter how I run it: from my virtualenv

Errors include ""Algorithm not supported"" for RS256 and ""Warning not raised"" in invokations of `client.parse_request_body_response()`.
