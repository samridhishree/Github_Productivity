There's a new version of [pytest](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest) available.
You are currently using **3.1.2**. I have updated it to **3.1.3**

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.1.3

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Fix decode error in Python 2 for doctests in docstrings. (`2434
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2434&gt;`_)

>- Exceptions raised during teardown by finalizers are now suppressed until all
>  finalizers are called, with the initial exception reraised. (`2440
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2440&gt;`_)

>- Fix incorrect &quot;collected items&quot; report when specifying tests on the command-
>  line. (`2464 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2464&gt;`_)

>- ``deprecated_call`` in context-manager form now captures deprecation warnings
>  even if the same warning has already been raised. Also, ``deprecated_call``
>  will always produce the same error message (previously it would produce
>  different messages in context-manager vs. function-call mode). (`2469
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2469&gt;`_)

>- Fix issue where paths collected by pytest could have triple leading ``/``
>  characters. (`2475 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2475&gt;`_)

>- Fix internal error when trying to detect the start of a recursive traceback.
>  (`2486 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2486&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Explicitly state for which hooks the calls stop after the first non-None
>  result. (`2493 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2493&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Create invoke tasks for updating the vendored packages. (`2474
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2474&gt;`_)

>- Update copyright dates in LICENSE, README.rst and in the documentation.
>  (`2499 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2499&gt;`_)
