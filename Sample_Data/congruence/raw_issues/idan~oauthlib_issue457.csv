"issue_title","457","idan","oauthlib","hoylen","2017-01-10 06:57:58","I installed _oauthlib_ 2.0.1 using the virtual environment support in the _pyCharm_ IDE. When running a short test program, I get an exception from _oauthlib/oauth1/rfc5859/signature.py_ line 473 where it tries to execute:

    import jwt.algorithms as jwtalgo

I've installed a module called ""jwt"" version 0.3.2 and that didn't solve the problem. Obviously that is not the JWT module it expects to be using, since it doesn't have an algorithms module.

**Which JWT module does _oauthlib_ depend upon**, because there's about 30 different modules available with the word ""jwt"" in their name!

It would be good if this was documented in the installation instructions. Thanks.","start issue","Which JWT module does oauthlib depend upon?"
