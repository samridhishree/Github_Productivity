The MyPy people have done a lot of work creating files containing the signatures of builtin/stdlib functions at https://github.com/python/typeshed.  By automatically processing the stub files, it would be possible to create more accurate mock ASTs for functions that aren't introspectable.

Does anyone know if there are any production-ready parsers for *.pyi file format?","",""

It will be huge, but it won't replace astroid.brain entirely. astroid.brain is much more potent than the ``.pyi`` files, because we can modify the AST at will, which leads to advanced inference support for:

* builtins

* constructs that depends on highly dynamic code such as enums and namedtuples

* tailored support for various libraries

We can't have this out of the box with ``.pyi`` files, so brain is here to stay, although probably not in its current form.","",""
