For instance, for a default value, astroid will return the function where it is used as its scope, but that's wrong, since the scope is actual the scope of the parent of the function.

```
#!python

def test(x=f): # the scope of f is test, it should be the scope of the parent of f
    pass
```

This is also true for the function annotation values.

.scope() returns the proper scope for Arguments's default values, function annotations and comprehensions. Closes issue #211.
