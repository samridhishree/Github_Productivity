I've implemented but not pushed a fix and am in the process of adding more rigorous unittests to prevent this from happening in the future. Expect this fix to be rolled out in a mini release tomorrow.

Thanks for reporting Lorenzo - https://plus.google.com/u/0/+LorenzoGilS%C3%A1nchez/posts/WfUxYxEAwDE?cfem=1

Instead it seems that work in progress locally modified but not committed or pushed changes were included in the push. This is a human error on my part and will create a bug to auto prevent this from happening in a future.

I will go ahead and release 0.7.2 without these unintended changes.
