This clearly makes sense for [diverging colormaps](http://matplotlib.org/examples/color/colormaps_reference.html) but it doesn't make sense if you want to show, for example, regions that are significantly positively correlated using the `autumn` map or any other [sequential colormaps](http://matplotlib.org/examples/color/colormaps_reference.html). Ideally I'd like to be able to use the whole range of the colormap for values ranging between `2.3` and `5.0`. As the code currently runs, I'm left with only yellow regions!

What I'd really like to do is to have the colorbar start at `2.3` and finish at `5.0` and for that range to cover the whole colormap.

It looks like it would be easy to change the [_get_colorbar_and_data_ranges](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/40069cb14b43333a73137797eac895cfb054db29/nilearn/plotting/img_plotting.py#L55) function to bring back the ability to set lower and upper limits for a colormap? Is there a reason not to?

So, I encountered myself again with this bug :rofl: 

The key here are in [these](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/nilearn/plotting/img_plotting.py#L1132-L1137) lines, where it could be that you have passed the function your vmin and `_get_colorbar_and_data_ranges` overwrites it and also assigns a mistaken `cbar_vmin`. I would like to solve this, but in `_get_colorbar_and_data_ranges` says clearly: 

```
if '    vmin_ = vmin' in kwargs:
        raise ValueError('this function does not accept a ""vmin"" '
                         'argument, as it uses a symmetrical range '
                         'defined via the vmax argument. To threshold '
                         'the plotted map, use the ""threshold"" argument')
```

So, IDK how to proceed. 

PS: @alexlicohen If you need a fast (but unclean) fix for this, just add a pair of lines in `plot_glass_brain` in your local nilearn package. One to save your value of  `vmin`  in the beginning

`vmin_ = vmin`

and another one to overwrite `vmin` and `cbar_vmin`, after `_get_colorbar_and_data_ranges` 

`vmin = cbar_vmin = vmin_ `","",""
