What function do you want to use apart from `mean`? We don't offer that choice either in NiftiLabelsMasker. We could add it but I want to check that it's not YAGNI.

An `inverse_transform` would rise a lot of other problems, like the shape to use. Plus, I don't see why anybody would want to visualize that. We definitely need visualization for seed based experiences but correlation matrix plot is much more fit than brains in that specific case.

For my analysis, I have a mask of ventral-temporal (VT) cortex.  For each voxel in that mask, I want a ball of nearby voxels.  I will use them to compute something (right now, a similarity matrix... but could be mean, std, etc.) that I then store as the value at that voxel position. I need to do that for every voxel in that VT mask.

It is very powerful to have a vector of voxels for each slice simultaneously.  Again, this is exactly what I need for RSA, but if you have a callback function, you can do whatever you want (using global variables).  It's very powerful.

My seeds are very dense.  I want to visualize the values coming out in brain space. 

As far as the input, I also don't want to have to specify seed locations in template space, but rather through voxel indices.  Otherwise, I'll have to do the `np.tensordot` logic myself, and that is not simple at all.

> I suggest that we focus on simple behavior for the moment. Since this question is common to spheres and labels masker, we can open an issue about that and discuss it. How does it sound?

I'm absolutely all for that, in all of these cases. :)  I think there are two things to discuss (allow specification of an `xform_fn`, allow specifying a `seed_img` as input / inverse_transform on output), would be glad to open two issues.  

Note that in my RSA project, I'm already using both of the above.  For me, it's just a question of whether it's potentially useful to others, to in `nilearn`.

From my understanding, a masker is for selecting subsets of voxels.
http://nilearn.github.io/building_blocks/pipeline_introduction.html#masking
I believe this fits how all the current maskers work.

Transformers are about filtering and/or modifying the data:
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/#apis-of-scikit-learn-objects

I would expect a `NiftiSpheresMasker` to mask the data without transforming it, while a `NiftiSpheresTransformer` to mask the data, then transform it.

Generalizing the `NiftiSpheresMasker` could form the basis of the searchlight procedure, the `NiftiSpheresTransformer`, and could easily be the basis of my RSA searchlight code (which is different from the classification-focused searchlight code).

Alternately, keeping this class as implemented, but changing the name to `NiftiSpheresTransformer`, would match the existing `nilearn` and `scikit-learn` object model schema better (and make future refactoring, if needed, avoid renaming objects).

class is doing and what it is for, so I fear that making it more general,

That said, I agree that there could be value, in a later PR, to extract
part of the logic of this class in a set of reusable functions, that
could be later combined in a different class, eg for RSA, relying on
similar operations. From a software design principle, the idea would be
that the high-level classes exposed to the user are different, to give a
simple picture of the package to the user, but they share some underlying
code. That's one of the strong values of externalizing the core

I should probably have separated it into two parts.  One is that I think calling this a `Masker` is confusing for users; it doesn't fit with the other maskers (it transforms data, not just extracting it).   The other is about how to go about doing the abstractions.

> In general, once the NiftiSpheresMasker is merged, one could simply derive new, more targeted classes from it.

I agree, but I think it's really a `Transformer`, not a `Masker`.  I think it's best to get names right first, so good to discuss before merging.  So to repeat: I think making it a pure masker, or calling it something else (my suggestion was `NiftiSpheresTransformer`) would fit the schema of what masks are, what transforms are, and therefore much clearer for users.

OK. But I do claim that this object belong to the same family of concepts
as our other ""masker"" objects, it is very close to the NiftiLabelsMasker
of the NiftiMapsMasker.

Maybe all the ""Masker"" objects should be renamed to ""Loader"" objects.

The name ""Transformer"" comes from the nomenclature of scikit-learn, by
which any object is one if it exposes the method ""transform"" and thus can
be used as a pipeline step. Evidently such an informatics concept may not
overlap 1000% with the intuitions of users, but: a) The maskers DO change
the data, e.g. by detrending/standardizing and b) you can see them as the
beginning of a pipeline even if the way it acts upon data is not always
compatible with the checks performed in the scikit-learn pipeline object.

`_mask_iter_img(niimgs, iter_element, mask_img=none)`
where `iter_element` is to be defined (I have ideas, but I don't want to explain all of this here as I'm not yet sure it will be feasible).

After that, advanced users like @bcipolli could directly import the iterator for their advanced code. This would factorize the code inside and the masker, and provide a useful object for methods people. However, this magic iterator being private, we don't guarantee any backward compatibility, which should not be a problem as it will only be used by advanced people (well, only by Ben and maybe Mehdi in our team I think ;)).

If `threshold` is an `uint8`, then you get `threshold = 22` and `-threshold = 234` because of the underflow. There may be other cases like that here and there in the code.

Should we properly handle uint8 everywhere or simply convert the image to float systematically for plotting?

For the record, this bug happened to @KamalakerDadi when he tried to plot the Harvard Oxford atlas (since Harvard Oxford is shipped in uint8 format). So this is not an isolated case.

I say convert to float: the problem with that is blowing up memory. But
