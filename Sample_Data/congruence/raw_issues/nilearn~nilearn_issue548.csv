I am trying to plot a map with values going from 0 to 1 (in theory), in a glass brain. 0 should be blue and 1 red. My problem is that the max of this map is 0.8 and it is plotted as maximum, so red. I would like to keep the color range fix and, for example, to plot values equal to 0.8 in orange, even if 1 values doesn't really exist in this particular map. The reason is because I have other maps where I want the 1s appearing in red.
Is this possible?

Thank you in advance,
fab
