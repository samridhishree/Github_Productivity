"issue_comment","1475","nilearn","nilearn","yarikoptic","2017-06-24 15:26:39","FWIW -- dependency on duecredit (if you check included in this PR `due.py`) is very very optional.  If there is no duecredit, all is good, no warning of any kind, etc.  Even if duecredit is installed, ATM you would need to explicitly enable duecredit mode (via DUECREDIT_ENABLE env var, or using `-m duecredit` option for interpreter) to get its machinery going.

But sure no problem, we could migrate those into the set of injections we maintain for such cases where upstream doesn't want to include them ""properly"".  In that case though it lives outside of the code base and there would be some cons (out of sync, etc)","",""
"issue_comment","1475","nilearn","nilearn","yarikoptic","2017-06-24 15:34:56","ha -- see you there (well -- here).
As for social vs technical -- it is both.  In many cases users do not know what they should have cited.  E.g. do you always cite our NeuroDebian when you use it? ;-) (and I suspect that you do)","",""
