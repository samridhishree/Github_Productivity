We should understand the following function calls and map them to their syntactic counterpart.

```
#!python

list([4, 5, 6])
set((1, 2, 3))
tuple(('a', 'b', 'c')
frozenset({1: 2})
dict(a=4, b=5)
```

Currently, astroid understand list/set/tuple calls without heterogenous elements and only with const nodes. Using tuple(('a', tuple(list([4]))) might not work right now, for instance.
The tricky part is the frozenset, which can't be mapped to a Set and it doesn't have an equivalent AST node.
