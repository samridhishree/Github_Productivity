This is problematic because in this case an unaware user can pass an int n as the argument and run  `haxby_dataset.func[0]`, which will return data for subject 1 instead of subject n. It seems to me that we should either:
- Make this use case explicit in the docstring or;
- Throw an error when `subjects` is an int.

Seems like download link from amazon is changed. Replacing fcp-indi -> fcp-indi-new in the fetcher download link will work.

> We recently migrated to a new AWS account.  As part of this migration, the data from the 'fcp-indi' bucket was synced to a temporary bucket ('fcp-indi-new') belonging to our new account.  After the migration of our data to the new account, our old account was deleted, and along with it the old 'fcp-indi' bucket.  In order to preserve the S3 paths that we had been using under the old account, we re-created the 'fcp-indi' bucket under our new account and began syncing all of the data in 'fcp-indi-new' to it.  At this time, I changed the URLs in our documentation to ensure that interested researchers could still access our data from the temporary bucket while it was syncing to the new 'fcp-indi' bucket.  Presently, the file sync is finished and the only reason that the temporary bucket ('fcp-indi-new') is still referred to in the documentation is that we also had to change permissions for all the files in 'fcp-indi' using a script so that they were publicly readable.  This script has finished executing, however, and I am reverting the documentation to refer to the 'fcp-indi' bucket now.

> So to answer your question, the data is the same in 'fcp-indi-new' and 'fcp-indi', but you shouldn't need to change your code.  In fact, you should use 'fcp-indi', since we are going to remove the 'fcp-indi-new' bucket now that our migration is finished.

Working through the Tutorials currently on: 8.1.3. 3D and 4D niimgs: handling and visualizing. Seems like the line:

rsn = datasets.fetch_atlas_smith_2009()['rsn10']

Is not downloading the correct file- this download resulted in a 3KB file that cannot be opened in FSLview instead of a larger 4D file.

Upon later calling rsn with this command: print(image.load_img(rsn).shape) I receive the error below.

Thanks,
Aki

Most of the time, this error is due to the fact that the file was downloaded on a website that requires authentication. So, what is downloaded is the login page of the network. You can check that by opening the file with your favorite text editor.

Let me know if it is the case. If so, I will add a check in Nilearn to circumvent it.
