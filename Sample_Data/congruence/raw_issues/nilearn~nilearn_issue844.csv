Indeed, I ""duckduckgoed"" a bit and found this post on SO:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33459574/import-matplotlib-png-as-png-import-error-dll-load-failed-the-specified-mod

The solution is to use anaconda instead of miniconda. I use anaconda on my Win box and I don't have this issue at all. Will try the proposed solution then.

367.6 MB for anaconda.

Appveyor proposes this http://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-cache but the cached archive cannot exceed 100MB. It's worth a try btw.

I'll find those and use miniconda instead, I'll also try the build cache provided by appveyor to speed up the installation step.

Just remove the cache section in appveyor.yml and I'll merge this one. Maybe add a comment about adding Library\bin to the %PATH% so we can remove it in the future when cond fix this issue. For reference the conda issue is here: https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/1753.
