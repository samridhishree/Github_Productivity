"issue_title","8","idan","oauthlib","ib-lundgren","2012-03-15 22:24:12","Client secret and resource owner secret are both optional per spec (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.4.2, see key 2) even if it would make no sense to not use at least one. Both secrets can safely be set to None without affecting HMAC. Also if the request is signed with RSA-SHA1 then none of the secrets will be used.

Resource owner key is only available in step 2 & 3 of the 3 step authentication (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-2). While it could still be submitted with an empty string as a value I think it is a better idea to leave it out of the parameters altogether.

Have a vague memory of reading in the spec somewhere that the client_key is optional but very highly recommended and I am not aware of any service that does not use it or why they would not. Since I cant link to it as of now and since it does not make sense not to use it I left it as a mandatory argument.

Please update this validation to reflect the new state of required vs optional parameters.
