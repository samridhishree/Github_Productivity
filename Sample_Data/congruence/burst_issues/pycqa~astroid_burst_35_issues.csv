It consists essentially in introducing the signature of the numpy functions that are in `numpy.core.umath` and `numpy.random.mtrand` modules.
This way, not only pylint doesn't emit 'no-member' message anymore but it is also able to check function arguments.

Does it mean that those unittests are never executed in the CI (because tox env doesn't install numpy)?",,
