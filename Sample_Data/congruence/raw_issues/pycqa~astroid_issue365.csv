A problem with circular imports caused me to compare a class name to a string in the joinedstr as_string method. It's fixable, but also felt like another pull request worth of code surgery. 

Without the change to delay_asattr in the second pull request there are a bunch of failed tests with python 3.6b1, specifically:

testExtensionModules
test_multiprocessing_manager
test_from_self_resolve
test_metaclass_generator_hack
test_lru_cache
test_namedtuple_advanced_inference
test_attribute_access

There  are a few other tests that are already failing on my machine, test_namespace_package_pth_support
test_builtin_fromlineno_missing on python3.5+

I took some stabs in the dark at fixing them, and can open more pull requests if you would like. But they might be pretty crude.
