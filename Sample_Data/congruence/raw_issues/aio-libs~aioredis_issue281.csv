There's a new version of [pytest](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest) available.
You are currently using **3.1.3**. I have updated it to **3.2.1**

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.2.1

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Fixed small terminal glitch when collecting a single test item. (`2579
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2579&gt;`_)

>- Correctly consider ``/`` as the file separator to automatically mark plugin
>  files for rewrite on Windows. (`2591 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2591&gt;`_)

>- Properly escape test names when setting ``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`` environment
>  variable. (`2644 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2644&gt;`_)

>- Fix error on Windows and Python 3.6+ when ``sys.stdout`` has been replaced
>  with a stream-like object which does not implement the full ``io`` module
>  buffer protocol. In particular this affects ``pytest-xdist`` users on the
>  aforementioned platform. (`2666 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2666&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Explicitly document which pytest features work with ``unittest``. (`2626
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2626&gt;`_)




>### 3.2.0

>=========================

>Deprecations and Removals
>-------------------------

>- ``pytest.approx`` no longer supports ``&gt;``, ``&gt;=``, ``&lt;`` and ``&lt;=``
>  operators to avoid surprising/inconsistent behavior. See `the docs
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/builtin.htmlpytest.approx&gt;`_ for more
>  information. (`2003 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2003&gt;`_)

>- All old-style specific behavior in current classes in the pytest&#39;s API is
>  considered deprecated at this point and will be removed in a future release.
>  This affects Python 2 users only and in rare situations. (`2147
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2147&gt;`_)

>- A deprecation warning is now raised when using marks for parameters
>  in ``pytest.mark.parametrize``. Use ``pytest.param`` to apply marks to
>  parameters instead. (`2427 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2427&gt;`_)


>Features
>--------

>- Add support for numpy arrays (and dicts) to approx. (`1994
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1994&gt;`_)

>- Now test function objects have a ``pytestmark`` attribute containing a list
>  of marks applied directly to the test function, as opposed to marks inherited
>  from parent classes or modules. (`2516 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2516&gt;`_)

>- Collection ignores local virtualenvs by default; `--collect-in-virtualenv`
>  overrides this behavior. (`2518 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2518&gt;`_)

>- Allow class methods decorated as ``staticmethod`` to be candidates for
>  collection as a test function. (Only for Python 2.7 and above. Python 2.6
>  will still ignore static methods.) (`2528 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2528&gt;`_)

>- Introduce ``mark.with_args`` in order to allow passing functions/classes as
>  sole argument to marks. (`2540 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2540&gt;`_)

>- New ``cache_dir`` ini option: sets the directory where the contents of the
>  cache plugin are stored. Directory may be relative or absolute path: if relative path, then
>  directory is created relative to ``rootdir``, otherwise it is used as is.
>  Additionally path may contain environment variables which are expanded during
>  runtime. (`2543 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2543&gt;`_)

>- Introduce the ``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`` environment variable that is set with
>  the ``nodeid`` and stage (``setup``, ``call`` and ``teardown``) of the test
>  being currently executed. See the `documentation
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/example/simple.htmlpytest-current-test-
>  environment-variable&gt;`_ for more info. (`2583 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2583&gt;`_)

>- Introduced ``pytest.mark.filterwarnings`` mark which allows overwriting the
>  warnings filter on a per test, class or module level. See the `docs
>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/warnings.htmlpytest-mark-
>  filterwarnings&gt;`_ for more information. (`2598 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2598&gt;`_)

>- ``--last-failed`` now remembers forever when a test has failed and only
>  forgets it if it passes again. This makes it easy to fix a test suite by
>  selectively running files and fixing tests incrementally. (`2621
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2621&gt;`_)

>- New ``pytest_report_collectionfinish`` hook which allows plugins to add
>  messages to the terminal reporting after collection has been finished
>  successfully. (`2622 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2622&gt;`_)

>- Added support for `PEP-415&#39;s &lt;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0415/&gt;`_
>  ``Exception.__suppress_context__``. Now if a ``raise exception from None`` is
>  caught by pytest, pytest will no longer chain the context in the test report.
>  The behavior now matches Python&#39;s traceback behavior. (`2631
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2631&gt;`_)

>- Exceptions raised by ``pytest.fail``, ``pytest.skip`` and ``pytest.xfail``
>  now subclass BaseException, making them harder to be caught unintentionally
>  by normal code. (`580 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/580&gt;`_)


>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Set ``stdin`` to a closed ``PIPE`` in ``pytester.py.Testdir.popen()`` for
>  avoid unwanted interactive ``pdb`` (`2023 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2023&gt;`_)

>- Add missing ``encoding`` attribute to ``sys.std*`` streams when using
>  ``capsys`` capture mode. (`2375 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2375&gt;`_)

>- Fix terminal color changing to black on Windows if ``colorama`` is imported
>  in a ``conftest.py`` file. (`2510 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2510&gt;`_)

>- Fix line number when reporting summary of skipped tests. (`2548
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2548&gt;`_)

>- capture: ensure that EncodedFile.name is a string. (`2555
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2555&gt;`_)

>- The options ``--fixtures`` and ``--fixtures-per-test`` will now keep
>  indentation within docstrings. (`2574 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2574&gt;`_)

>- doctests line numbers are now reported correctly, fixing `pytest-sugar122
>  &lt;https://github.com/Frozenball/pytest-sugar/issues/122&gt;`_. (`2610
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2610&gt;`_)

>- Fix non-determinism in order of fixture collection. Adds new dependency
>  (ordereddict) for Python 2.6. (`920 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/920&gt;`_)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Clarify ``pytest_configure`` hook call order. (`2539
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2539&gt;`_)

>- Extend documentation for testing plugin code with the ``pytester`` plugin.
>  (`971 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/971&gt;`_)


>Trivial/Internal Changes
>------------------------

>- Update help message for ``--strict`` to make it clear it only deals with
>  unregistered markers, not warnings. (`2444 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2444&gt;`_)

>- Internal code move: move code for pytest.approx/pytest.raises to own files in
>  order to cut down the size of python.py (`2489 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2489&gt;`_)

>- Renamed the utility function ``_pytest.compat._escape_strings`` to
>  ``_ascii_escaped`` to better communicate the function&#39;s purpose. (`2533
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2533&gt;`_)

>- Improve error message for CollectError with skip/skipif. (`2546
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2546&gt;`_)

>- Emit warning about ``yield`` tests being deprecated only once per generator.
>  (`2562 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2562&gt;`_)

>- Ensure final collected line doesn&#39;t include artifacts of previous write.
>  (`2571 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2571&gt;`_)

>- Fixed all flake8 errors and warnings. (`2581 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-
>  dev/pytest/issues/2581&gt;`_)

>- Added ``fix-lint`` tox environment to run automatic pep8 fixes on the code.
>  (`2582 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2582&gt;`_)

>- Turn warnings into errors in pytest&#39;s own test suite in order to catch
>  regressions due to deprecations more promptly. (`2588
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2588&gt;`_)

>- Show multiple issue links in CHANGELOG entries. (`2620
>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2620&gt;`_)
