"issue_title","182","idan","oauthlib","vitriol","2013-06-20 12:19:13","hi there.
I've been playing around with the client_credentials and password grant types, as well as the refresh_token grant for tokens issued with the former.

With client_credentials and password, I can  send multiple space separated scopes in the `scope` post var which gets transferred into the oauthlib.Request.scopes as a list. So far, fine.
When I try the token_refresh grant, it seems it never looks into the scope param in the request, always looks for the scopes, which of course is not there, because the function that turns the space separated list of scopes into a list is never called.

Am I missing something?

Steps to reproduce:
1.make a client_credentials request with scope = 'scope1 scope2'
2.Use the refresh token obtained from this response and make another request with grant_type=refresh_token and scope = 'scope1 scope2'
It will fail to validate request

Thanks for reporting this issue! The OAuth 2 grant types tests are still a bit lacking and for refresh token none even existed. Until now that is =) The `GrantTypeBase.validate_scopes` function was never refactored to be used in refresh token as it should have been, thus resulting in the inconsistency you observed.
