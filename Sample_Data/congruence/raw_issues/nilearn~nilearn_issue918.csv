There are still problems since some lateralized regions are splitted because they cross the inter-hemispheric limit but this PR, as for now, addresses most problems.

Actually, my test is the real atlas. But I can't use it in the test suite so I've just put a test using toy data.

The PR should is now mergeable.

For sub cortical, should invalidate the use of symmetric_split because it gives strange things

``` Python
from nilearn import datasets
atlas = datasets.fetch_atlas_harvard_oxford('sub-maxprob-thr0-1mm', symmetric_split=True)
print(atlas.labels[2])
```

gives `Left Cerebral White Matter, right part`
