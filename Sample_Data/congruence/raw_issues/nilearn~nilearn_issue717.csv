Click on ""nodes+edges 2"" to get the netjs graph.
Sniff a little bit, find that ""main.js"" do the job.
Open it: https://db.humanconnectome.org/megatrawl/3T_Q1-Q6related468_MSMsulc_d25_ts2/netjs/js/main.js
Find the matrices, eg : https://db.humanconnectome.org/megatrawl/3T_Q1-Q6related468_MSMsulc_d25_ts2/netjs/data/dataset1/Znet2.txt

The files are very light, we can totally include them directly into nilearn. However, they have a user agreement that we must include.

Most of the work will be to understand dataformat and load it in a user-friendly fashion.

I let anybody motivated take it from here ;).
