"issue_title","69","idan","oauthlib","senko","2012-11-13 10:15:34","With the refactoring of `verify_request()` to return request as well as verification result, it started having incosistent return value type. If nonce/timestamp weren't validated, only plain `False` was returned (as previously), but for all other (non-exception) errors, the tuple `(False, <request>)` was returned.

As a side effect, this also hid a failure in one of the tests (which I updated accordingly, from what I can see, the only problem was in signature so I've updated that).

The branch updates `verify_request()` to always return `(<verification_result>,  <request>)` as result, and updates the tests accordingly.
