We need to stress that the typical situation is to start from beta maps, and that those beta maps need to be estimated by another software.

Also, we need to have other datasets that are made of beta maps to make the examples more realistic.

I am thinking that we could host online the beta maps from the Jimura &
Poldrack data (I need to ask Poldrack's permission, but I expect that it
won't be a problem). We also need a good classification setting, as this
is really the most common situation. For this one, I am still looking.
Maybe beta maps computed from https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000107 . We
need to ask @schwarty about that last one. He would know.

See Dimitri Papadopoulos if you want to set up a downloader for those data.

Yes, but in terms of prediction (decoding) that is not a very interesting
problem.

Creating a fetcher, then trying to create an example, could be a great use of my time in getting more familiar with the package and neuroimaging analysis in general.
