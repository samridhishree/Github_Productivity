I just installed nilearn following the user guide. I am using an academic license of Enthought Canopy (1.1.1.1452) which is the replacement for EPD. Following the instruction in **1.2.2.2. Setting up** of the [user guide](http://nilearn.github.io/introduction.html#installation) nilearn lands in **.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages** which is by default not part of the canopy path. Therefore the next line in the guide `import nilearn` will fail.

Maybe an additional line in the user guide to on how to add the install location to the path or dropping the --user option will help.

However installing with the --user option using canopy python is still successful in the sense that nilearn in the ~/.local path is then accessible to the system python - which however does not have all the other dependencies.

Canopy seems to have its own, separate user path at `Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/lib/python2.7/site-packages`. If I leave the --user option while installing, this is where nilearn ends up. I am not sure what the difference is to `Enthought/Canopy_64bit/System/lib/python2.7/site-packages` which contains less packages.

Computing non-specific confounds on preprocessed image is dangerous, for
instance, as pointed out by Basile on Tuesday, the global signal mean
will contain strong traces of the resampling done in the realign step.

In terms of software design, when we integrate the HV confounds, I would
like to do this in terms of a transform, but that means that we need to
change the design of nilearn to take dictionaries for X, and that's a
much larger design work that we will undertake later.

If you need it for your own codebase, for instance because you don't have
access to the raw data, I suggest that you sublass the NiftiMasker that
you are using to add the functionality in your codebase. It should not be
hard to do the subclassing.

OK, based on my experience it works better when using the raw data.

Anyhow, as long as we haven't a clear idea on these choices, I am not
very enthousiastic at the idea of making high-level objects. I would like
to get empirical validation of the pipeline before implementing it in
nilearn before I am worried about the combinatorial explosion of options.

I think that we have more to do before. I also think that we need to
change the way we pass information in and out of objects before we
tackle this problem.

hold.

In contrast, on postprocessed images they might also take into account variance introduced during the alignment process. Physiologically induced confounds should be available both before and after preprocessing the data, so not sure whether that should make a big difference.

However, on one a super computers and on a brandnew local

Disturbingly, this bug does not appears to be systematically

behavior we experienced on both super computer and cluster.

On the cluster, lunching the Python script single-threaded (n_jobs=1)

given only 40 niftis as input), ~22GB when n_jobs=2 and throws almost

1,issue_title,179,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2014-03-31 15:33:35,"When fetching a dataset, the programmer provides a list of the files to be downloaded. If he provides two files with the same name, eg `http://web.fr/xxx/archive.zip` and `http://web.fr/yyy/archive.zip`, then a local file archive.zip.part will be created when the first file is downloaded, extracted and deleted, and it is the same for the second file.

This induces two problems:
- if something goes wrong, we may start downloading `http://web.fr/yyy/archive.zip`, and then resuming system may resume a download of `http://web.fr/xxx/archive.zip` using `archive.zip.part` file, thinking that it is the same file
- if someday we want to download file in parallel, this cannot work.

We have now to decide if it's a programmer related issue, and then we can give him a way to rename a file, or if it's a nilearn issue, and then we have to solve it.

A solution would be to assign a unique name to the file when downloading it. What I have in mind is:
- using the E-tag header value if available
- using a hash combining the download URL and file-size otherwise.

We can also download the first bytes of the files before resuming: headers often contains a hash of the file. I don't think that it is a reliable solution.

My attempts to install nilearn have failed so far, I cannot seem to
find what the problem is.

My system has Ubuntu Linux with python 2.7.3
![install_log txt gz](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5262793/987158/61ead10e-08e6-11e3-9f7e-19dfd61c94bf.jpg)

and
 numpy     v1.6.1
 scipy       v0.9.0
 sklearn    v0.14.1
 matplotlib v1.1.1rc

The steps I have taken are:
1. git clone https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn.git python/nilearn
2. git remote add nilearn https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn.git
3. cd python/nilearn;   make install
4. cd ../../;                 git pull nilearn master # today
5. cd python/nilearn;   make install

But the messages I get (see attached) suggests that many library import fail.
Does this mean that there still are unmet dependencies?

Many thanks for your help!

This should be fixed right now. However, you should install nilearn by doing ""make install"" in nilearn directory, not in the doc directory.

Thanks for your feedback ! We try as much as possible to run compilation from scratch but I think my local repository is polluted by temporary files.

To use nilearn, you do not need to 'make' it. Normally, cloning the git repository is enough:

```
git clone https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn.git
python plot_rest_clustering.py
```

... should work (nilearn will be imported locally). If you really want to install it, use:

```
python setup.py install
```

I will try to fix the bugs you pointed out as fast as possible but I have other tasks pending. I hope that these installation problems did not dissuade you tu use nilearn !

Do not hesitate to give us a feedback and, if you have an interesting experiment using open data, then maybe we could add it as an example !

Best,

Alexandre.

I did run make from the nilearn directory (as described)?
If I ended up in the doc directory that must have been where the Makefile left me...

After the git pull I still had to manually change 
 ./doc/_build/html/_downloads/plot_nifti_advanced.py
 ./doc/_build/html/_downloads/plot_old_canica_resting_state.py
 ./doc/_build/html/_downloads/plot_ica_resting_state.py
 ./doc/auto_examples/plot_nifti_advanced.py
 ./doc/auto_examples/plot_old_canica_resting_state.py
 ./doc/auto_examples/plot_ica_resting_state.py
 ./plot_nifti_advanced.py
 ./plot_old_canica_resting_state.py
 ./plot_ica_resting_state.py
to replace io by input_data

Also in 
 emacs doc/Makefile 
there is a mention of niearn which should probably be nilearn.

After doing all that the commands <in the nilearn directory>
make clean && make install

result in the following output: 
![install log](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5262793/1000671/81904a62-0a52-11e3-80e3-4977c30e6433.jpg)
--another jpg text file--

I've done this a couple of time in a row, and in short
1. the example scripts only need to run one time, except the plot_old_canica_resting_state.py script, which is called twice in every 'make install', and is not successful
2. the pdf file is not built (possibly because of a syntax error in \FancyVerb [which I dont know]?)
3. after the pdf generation, another clone attempt also fails.

Hope this report is of use, very happy that the clustering script works.

Actually, ""calculation (auditory and visual cue) + sentence listening and reading vs button press"" IS very long and unreadable. Besides, it cannot hold on one line, which makes documentation difficult to write.

Therefore, I dare insisting on the fact that I would like to call ""calculation"" the current ""calculation (auditory and visual cue)"" contrast. This will for instance simplify ""calculation (auditory and visual cue) + sentence listening and reading vs button press"" into ""calculation + sentences vs button press"". It also make us able to keep the name ""button press"", without needing to put ""(auditory and visual cue)"" afterwards for the sake of consistency.
