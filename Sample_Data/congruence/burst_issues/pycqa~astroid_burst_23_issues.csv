I'm not sure what happens after upgrading to pytest 3.0 - the old code snippet would probably raise an `AttributeError`, but I don't get any `no-member` messages anyways?

We have the same issue with our travis.
What is the best way to fix it?
Is a good idea to have incompatibility with other setuptools versions?
",,
6,issue_comment,358,pycqa,astroid,jayvdb,2016-08-22 18:28:25,"The problem is setuptools has incompatibility with itself for environment markers.
You can read more about it at https://github.com/pypa/packaging/issues/72#issuecomment-232820331 to the end.
And `setup_requires` is not a solution that works reliably for older versions of setuptools either.

And setuptools downgrading to 1.1.6 on travis is not something I have seen before, and should be considered a bug somewhere else (not astroid).  It might be another case of #4194 (which I have only glanced at, so I might be off base there).
",,
7,issue_comment,358,pycqa,astroid,moylop260,2016-08-22 18:59:51,"Thanks @jayvdb for the information.
My question is:
Should astroid lose full compatibility with old `setuptools` and show this error in some environments?

I mean, What is the advantage of use https://github.com/PyCQA/astroid/commit/41a0c77cab88a54787d49913030bebf482fa014c vs disadvantages?

8,issue_comment,358,pycqa,astroid,jayvdb,2016-08-22 21:32:11,"The advantage is universal wheels. And the disadvantages are it doesnt work on many versions of setup tools, unless my hack is added.

9,issue_comment,358,pycqa,astroid,PCManticore,2016-08-23 05:55:45,"Does this issue still has to be open? From my point of view, the environment markers are quite important when having to deal with multiple Python releases, each with a different set of dependencies, which is why 41a0c77 (and similar commits in pylint) was made in the first place. A release was fudged, because the wheel was built with 3.5, but the installation failed on older 3.X versions.

The release is a universal wheel, so that should not matter.
",,
11,issue_comment,358,pycqa,astroid,PCManticore,2016-08-23 06:51:59,"I might have forgot the details, but this happened because some of
dependencies were not installed when installing astroid / pylint on other
releases, due to the Python version checks in the installation script. The
environment markers fixed this, so something was amiss there.
