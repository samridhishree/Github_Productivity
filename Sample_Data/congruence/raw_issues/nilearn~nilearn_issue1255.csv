A better way to solve this issue would be to fix the ""affine"" attribute of the _MNI152Template. The way you can do this is using Python ""properties"", they are functions that are called upon access of an attribute. It is actually done in the _MNI152Template for the 'shape' attribute, so you have to mimic the strategy used for ""shape"".
