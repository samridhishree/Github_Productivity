I've personally never used bdist_rpm before and had no idea it was that broken. The fix should really be there and with the .spec it generates rather than in the licence field. However,  I rather have it being easy to to package and distribute oauthlib than nitpick =)

If you would happen to notice when this is fixed, please ping me or send another PR. Cheers
