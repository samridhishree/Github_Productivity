In the documentation found here https://oauthlib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/oauth2/endpoints/token.html we can read the following bit:
`# body will contain the token in json format and expiration from now`
`# in seconds.`
`{`
    `'access_token': 'sldafh309sdf',`
    `'refresh_token': 'alsounguessablerandomstring',`
    `'expires_in': 3600,`
    `'scopes': [`
        `'https://example.com/userProfile',`
        `'https://example.com/pictures'`
    `],`
    `'token_type': 'Bearer'`
`}`
But the returned body doesn't have a 'scopes' key, it has 'scope'. Furthermore, the value is not a list of strings, one string per each scope, but just a string with the scopes separeted by spaces.  
Cheking the code, in [/oauth2/rfc6749/tokens.py](https://github.com/idan/oauthlib/blob/4a14f204908eb7f6fb9ac3a0ece5730b3d4146cb/oauthlib/oauth2/rfc6749/tokens.py) lines 216 and 217 I found:
`if request.scopes is not None:`
    `token['scope'] = ' '.join(request.scopes)`
Which is the cause of the issue. 

The fix should be to change either the documentation or this line so they match. That decission is yours but I could help fixing one of both if needed.
Cheers!

2,issue_comment,284,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2014-10-24 13:50:13,"The current implementation is working as intended but the documentation should be updated.

As of next release...
- On the provider side you, e.g. in `validator.save_bearer_token`, can use `token.scopes` to access this list of scope strings.
- On the client side side you can first load the dict with json.loads and then use `oauthlib.oauth.OAuth2Token` to access the scope as a list. (This will happen automatically in extensions like requests-oauthlib). 

```
>>> from oauthlib.oauth2 import OAuth2Token
>>> token = OAuth2Token(json.loads(request_body))
['https://example.com/userProfile', 'https://example.com/pictures']
```

If you fancy updating the docs that'd be awesome :)
