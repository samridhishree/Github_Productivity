The docstring of scipy could be an inspiration.

As mentionned here (https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/modules.html#importing-from-a-package), I also defined and filled the **__all__** attribute with the ""public"" submodules of nilearn.

We could also go further by writing the all docstring in all submodules.

I think it's probably overkill for now.

A couple of tips:
- double underscore does emphasis (aka bold) in markdown so you want to use backquotes to escape them, see this [link](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for more details.
- using Fix #number in a PR description does automatically close the issue #number once the PR is merged
