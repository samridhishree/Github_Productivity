```
import asyncio
import aioredis

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

async def go():
    pool = await aioredis.create_pool(
        ('localhost', 6379),
        minsize=5, maxsize=10,
        loop=loop)
    await pool.execute('set', 'my-key', 'value')
    print(await pool.execute('get', 'my-key'))
    # graceful shutdown
    pool.close()
    await pool.wait_closed()

loop.run_until_complete(go())
```

However, when I try running this example, I receive the following error:

```
$ python redistest.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""redistest.py"", line 17, in <module>
    loop.run_until_complete(go())
  File ""/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.2/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/asyncio/base_events.py"", line 467, in run_until_complete
    return future.result()
  File ""redistest.py"", line 11, in go
    await pool.execute('set', 'my-key', 'value')
AttributeError: 'RedisPool' object has no attribute 'execute'
```

This is with `aioredis==1.0.0b2` from PyPI.","start issue","Pool API doesn't seem to match example"
