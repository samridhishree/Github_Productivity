@schwarty : I believe that you have prototyping code that goes in this direction, maybe we can look at that in detail at the sprint.

"issue_comment","201","nilearn","nilearn","eickenberg","2014-06-16 07:42:38","This decoding object needs to be able to take a classifier, but have a standard one. Most importantly, it needs to be flexible wrt cross-validation objects. Different experiments and different analyses require very different cross-validation strategies.
