As #998 and #999 are merged, only changing the version to 3.4 made the job. I kept python 3.4 because the most recent compatible with sphinx 1.2.3.
Question: is there a specific reason why we use this version of sphinx ?

Can you verify the generated documentation is ok ? https://circle-artifacts.com/gh/aabadie/nilearn/300/artifacts/0/home/ubuntu/nilearn/doc/_build/html/index.html

See http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/changes.html#release-1-3-2-released-nov-29-2015 and search for autosummary. So in principle we don't need to use sphinx=1.2.3 anymore. Maybe worth investigating.
