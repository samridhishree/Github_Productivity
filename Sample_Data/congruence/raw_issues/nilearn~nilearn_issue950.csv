The actual policy in nilearn is to name it `load_atlas`. `load` because it is not downloaded and `atlas` because we do not differentiate atlases from coordinates ATM. I suggest that you set this name and we open an issue to discuss atlas vs. coords.

I changed the function naming. Then  `fetch_atlas_power_2011` also should be renamed using coords I think.
I have a problem in the documentation: in the modules reference page only the first sentence is given so it stops at ""...Dosenbach et al."" . I don't know how to avoid this ?
@KamalakerDadi  `datasets.fetch_abide_pcp(derivatives=['rois_dosenbach160'])` gives ABIDE time-series extracted from an atlas of spheres of 4.5 mm radius around these coordinates.

I do wonder if we should call this an atlas? Maybe fetch_coords_dosenbach
rather?

Really? I don't think that we should strive to summarize or explain
methods that we are not implementing.

That's the terminology they use in the paper. I would simply leave it
like that, and reference the paper.
