I am using your package some months now. Somehow I wasn't able to plot Nifti1 images anymore.
Using and function from `nilearn.plotting` gives me the `AttrributeError: Unknown property facecolor`.

Here is the Traceback:
```
`Traceback (most recent call last):

```

I am hoping you can tell me how to fix this, because I am using your tools very often.

Thanks in advance and greetings,
Daniel

I already solved the problem myself. But somehow another, different Error pops up.

Just by trying to `import nilearn.plotting` the Traceback looks like this

```
from nilearn import plotting

Unfortunately the minimal reproducible script only contains one line:
`from nilearn import plotting`

Furthermore, I remind you that the problem is not importing `nilearn.plotting`, but that there is something wrong with a module.","",""

Since the problem was a false/defect module I went for:
1. Uninstall matplotlib
2. Uninstall nilearn
and then installed all again.
There really was a dependecy issue with nilearn and matplotlib.

Nevertheless, I thank you for your help.","",""
