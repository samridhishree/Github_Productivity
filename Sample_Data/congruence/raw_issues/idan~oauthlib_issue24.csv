"issue_title","24","idan","oauthlib","ib-lundgren","2012-04-26 11:09:30","Idan found an annoying issue with urlparse.parse_qsl when using the strict_parsing flag [1]. The issue boils down to parse_qsl treating a single name string as invalid (ie ""c2"") since it does not include an equals sign. This is not according to the spec for x-www-form-urlencoded.

My idea of strict parsing would be that only properly formatted x-www-form-urlencoded strings were parsed and otherwise a value error was raised, this is not the case with parse_qsl.

Thus, here is urldecode which extends parse_qsl with query string validation. If you like urldecode ill refactor OAuthLib to use it instead of parse_qsl.

off topic: seem to have thrown in quite a few commits, bit off a serial committer, should i merge those 7 together somehow?

Regarding serial commits: meh. It would be nice to have them squashed, but we'll survive just fine without it :) Squash commits next time.
