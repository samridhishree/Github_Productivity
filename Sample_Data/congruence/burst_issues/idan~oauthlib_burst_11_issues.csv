We now have 3 versions spread out with @sontek starting on some (#58), my local one which is close to complete authorization grant code and implicit grant code support and this one. This is my fault since after doing the initial work way back this summer I wanted to reorganize it a bit and broke all the tests, which is the state it has remained in since, and because of this I never pushed it.

I will try and get around to cleaning it up and merging it in here this week and if I can't find time for that I'll just push the slightly messy code I have now and whoever feel like it can tear it apart in search for useful bits.

0,issue_title,68,idan,oauthlib,warsaw,2012-11-12 22:11:10,"Porting a library from oauth to oauthlib, is fairly straightforward.  One thing I ran into was the test for unicode_type in oauth1/rfc5849/utils.py escape() function.

This happens because the old api passes the token (a.k.a. resource_owner) key/secret and consumer (a.k.a. client) token/key as Python 2 8-bit strings.  When Client.sign() is subsequently called, these values are passed to escape() which throws the ValueError.

The workaround in my own code is to .decode('utf-8') them when they are isinstance(value, bytes), but it seems crufty to require this in clients which will support both python 2 and python 3 (e.g. using un-prefixed string literals in test cases).

Why couldn't unescape() do the decoding for you?

Thanks for the reference to issue #53.  I only briefly skimmed RFC 5849, but I
saw no indication as to the required character set for the keys/secrets.
That's a bit surprising, but maybe I missed it.  If not, well, I guess being
strict about the inputs makes the most sense, despite it being inconvenient.

Of course, if the keys/secrets are not unicodes or utf-8 encoded bytes
already, you could just let the .decode('utf-8') failure percolate up to the
caller.  That way, the most obvious choice would be covered, and any corner
cases would raise errors by Python itself.  I personally think it's crazy to
use anything other than utf-8 here, but maybe there's a good use case I'm
missing (frankly, it seems like all keys/secrets are ascii anyway, but that's
probably being too strict).

It is off by default and almost entirely untested. Fancy trying it out and see if it meets your needs somewhat? If not please let me know where it's lacking.

Of course, it's possible the various components aren't of the same encoding, but then I think that would be just as insane as using something other than utf-8 ;).  FWIW, below is a merge proposal which shows how I did this in in a package I just converted from oauth to oauthlib.

I had another thought.  Given that unicodes are required, perhaps it would be better to validate the parameters as early as possible, such that the ValueError was raised in the Client.**init**() instead of later during signing.  IOW, if you're going to throw the exception, throw it as early as possible, as close to the source of error as possible.

https://code.launchpad.net/~barry/piston-mini-client/lp1077083/+merge/135449

I also think you could collapse convert_to_unicode and encoding into a single encoding parameter.  If it were None, no conversion would be done.  (But I understand this is mostly for experimental purposes.)

And yea if they have mutliple encodings for various params the responsibility to convert sure falls on them from my pov. I agree with the exception being thrown early but when that check was written there was no such thing as Client and since then it's just not happened. Will take a look at maybe integrating that into where i now attempt conversion.

Will have a look at your merge proposal, should be a good source of examples for the docs when they feel like being written =)

The related code is here: https://code.google.com/p/gabr/source/browse/application/views/status.py?r=c67d65b90bdf78d07d4fe92cc1e8f9827cb5eaf8#22

So i must unicode the parameters first: https://code.google.com/p/gabr/source/browse/application/views/status.py?r=7eb65d488db14fb1ced0c848c0334f894191ab7b#20

It's caused by https://github.com/idan/oauthlib/blob/1edaaf2f5e92744e4fd06c908e507a47279b3db9/oauthlib/oauth1/rfc5849/utils.py#L52 which will check the type of the parameters.

But i think it's not necessary, because what common.quote do is that it encode the unicode string to utf8, call urllib.quote and decode it. I think even this unicode intermediate object is unnecessary, because the only calling is from https://github.com/idan/oauthlib/blob/989606369bd8716c97aad7c94543344f4072e7d5/oauthlib/oauth1/rfc5849/signature.py#L373 which convert the object to unicode string again in the next statement.

And i think common.quote is unncessary, because the only calling is from oauth1/rfc5849/utils.py , the rest in this package is directly calling urllib.quote.

So i think, we should just encoding it if it's a unicode object or do nothing else.

The related code is here: https://code.google.com/p/gabr/source/browse/application/views/status.py?r=c67d65b90bdf78d07d4fe92cc1e8f9827cb5eaf8#22

So i must unicode the parameters first: https://code.google.com/p/gabr/source/browse/application/views/status.py?r=7eb65d488db14fb1ced0c848c0334f894191ab7b#20

It's caused by https://github.com/idan/oauthlib/blob/1edaaf2f5e92744e4fd06c908e507a47279b3db9/oauthlib/oauth1/rfc5849/utils.py#L52 which will check the type of the parameters.

But i think it's not necessary, because what common.quote do is that it encode the unicode string to utf8, call urllib.quote and decode it. I think even this unicode intermediate object is unnecessary, because the only calling is from https://github.com/idan/oauthlib/blob/989606369bd8716c97aad7c94543344f4072e7d5/oauthlib/oauth1/rfc5849/signature.py#L373 which convert the object to unicode string again in the next statement.

And i think common.quote is unncessary, because the only calling is from oauth1/rfc5849/utils.py , the rest in this package is directly calling urllib.quote.

So i think, we should just encoding it if it's a unicode object or do nothing else.

I remember chewing on this a while back. Basically, we have two choices:
- Guess the encoding of any strings passed to oauthlib
- Require that all strings passed to oauthlib be unicode

> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
> [PEP 20](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)

I agree that it's inconvenient to have to supply all your data, even dict members, as unicode strings—however the alternative is some poor developer tearing their hair out because they're passing in strings with an encoding other than UTF-8.

Down the road maybe we should be using chardet for this.

It's worth noting that `urllib.quote()/unquote()` doesn't properly handle unicode data, nor is it completely safe to simply encode to UTF-8:
1. http://bugs.python.org/issue1712522
2. http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2006-July/067335.html

So even code like this can apparently have edge cases:

``` python
urllib.quote(foo.encode('UTF-8'))
```

I haven't looked at the code you're touching in months, and I remember that it was a source of pain when we originally wrote it—so you'll have to be a bit patient while I load it back into my brain and figure out what to do with this patch. Thanks!

I've just pushed some changes to provider that I had written a while back but until now lacked a few updates to be pushed. I think they might address some of the points you mentioned but I'll have a detailed look this week, hopefully we have not duplicated effort =)

I'm thrilled that you are digging into the provider bit and would love to cooperate on it, I'll try and enumerate the next steps that I think needs to be done at some point this week. I'll ping you when I do...

0,issue_title,101,idan,oauthlib,matthewlmcclure,2013-02-04 22:44:10,"This looks like a regression between 0.3.4 and 0.3.5 to me. I'm guessing it was caused by  the automatic urlencoding introduced between those tags. (cf. #96)

Here's a test program:

```
from __future__ import unicode_literals
import logging
from pprint import pprint

import requests
from requests_oauthlib import OAuth1


logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

client_key = 'aclientkey'
client_secret = 'aclientsecret'
token_credentials = {
    'oauth_token': ['atokentoken'],
    'oauth_token_secret': ['atokensecret']
}
resource_url = 'http://example.com/'
method = 'POST'

oauth = OAuth1(client_key, client_secret,
               unicode(token_credentials['oauth_token'][0]),
               unicode(token_credentials['oauth_token_secret'][0]),
               signature_type='QUERY')
req = requests.Request(method=method, url=resource_url,
                       headers={ 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' },
                       data='some body data that is not application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
                       auth=oauth).prepare()

pprint(req.__dict__)
```

And here's the output in 0.3.5 vs 0.3.4. Note the inclusion of the body in the base signing string in 0.3.5 and that the Content-Type somehow gets set to application/x-www-formurlencoded despite my having set it to text/plain.

Also interesting that Client.sign did not pick up on the already set content type, will need to revisit that check. Unfortunately its midnight here but I will have a look at this tomorrow.

I'll try and simply improve the Client.sign header checking, failing that ill either revert back or add something like a urlencode=True kwarg to extract_params and urldecode, possibly to Client.sign as well.
