"issue_title","776","nilearn","nilearn","bcipolli","2015-09-08 20:28:09","I just read Naselarise et al. (2011) about encoding vs. decoding--I'm sure people here are familiar with it. They advocate for experiments to target encoding models, and to derive decoding models via Bayes rule.

Encoding models include a Gabor jet (Kay et al., 2008), Semantic features (Naselarise et al., 2009), and later features from ConvNets (Agrawal et al., 2014). A recent paper from JoN (Guclu & van Gerven, 2015) used an encoding model based on a ConvNet to try and associate voxel responses to layers of the neural network, with a goal similar to work I saw @eickenberg present at OHBM 2015.

I believe the Kay and Naselarise data are publicly available (http://crcns.org/data-sets/vc/vim-1/about-vim-1), and there may be relevant code available (perhaps in MATLAB: http://cvnlab.net/resources.html).

Seems a nice complement to the decoding work here to have an encoding example, and do the simple Bayes rule computation to create the decoding model. A bit of work, but what do you think?

Unfortunately you need a verified login for crcns in order to download any data. Although one could create downloaders that actually do the login process given the credentials, I believe that the nilearn policy for downloaders is that the data should be directly/easily downloadable, as is the case with the datasets from openfmri for example.

I think this is the only blocker. Otherwise an example would be really nice to have.

I don't recall this being clearly stated positively anywhere. (So usually
that means negative, right?)
Neither is there a clear (global) licensing document anywhere on crcns as
far as I remember (I think I asked at some point).
