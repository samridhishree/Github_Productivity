It appears that astroid (tested with version ``1.5.3``) doesn't correctly infer ``namedtuple`` type when ``field_names`` parameter name is specified:

Without the name:
```python
In [1]: from astroid import builder
In [2]: next(builder.extract_node('''
   ...: from collections import namedtuple
   ...: namedtuple('a', ['a'])
   ...: ''').infer())
Out[2]: <ClassDef.a l.3 at 0x7fa8b643fa58>
```
With the name:
```python
In [1]: from astroid import builder
In [2]: next(builder.extract_node('''
   ...: from collections import namedtuple
   ...: namedtuple('a', field_names=['a'])
   ...: ''').infer())
Out[2]: Uninferable
```

Thanks,
