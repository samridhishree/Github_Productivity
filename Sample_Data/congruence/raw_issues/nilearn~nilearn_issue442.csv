if a masker is constructed in `MultiPCA`, it does not provide the `verbose` flag.  

On my machine, this causes the first 60+ seconds of the `connectivity/plot_canica_resting_state.py` example to proceed in silence, despite `verbose=10` being passed to `CanICA`.

I have made the change locally on my machine; happy to submit a PR.
