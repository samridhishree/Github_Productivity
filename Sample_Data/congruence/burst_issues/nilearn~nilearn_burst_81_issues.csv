Can you clarify where do you want to put shelving on `compute_multi_epi_masks` / `compute_multi_epi_masks` ? By shelving the results of `compute_epi_masks` I reckon ?

Also I think that the `shelve` param is useless for NiftiMasker, but we have to expose it if we do not want to copy `transform_single_imgs` in `MultiNiftiMasker`

No refactor. An example in the advanced section would be good. Not sure

If they are very small, we should include them in the codebase (hence with a ""load_brain_mask"" function in datasets). If not, we need to create a ""fetch_brain_mask"" function in the downloaders.

If we choose to obtain it from the MNI template, eg doing:

<pre>
target_img = datasets.load_mni152_template()
grey_voxels = (target_img.get_data() > 0).astype(int)
mask_img = new_img_like(target_img, grey_voxels)
</pre>

we don't need to store anything addition. That might be the simplest / best solution.

I am just being extra careful. I'd rather take a small performance hit
rather than having code that might not work on a user's computer (eg

Changing the background of the figure would be fine provided we check that the figure facecolor is not different than the default from rcParams.

I have a change on my machine that does this, but I'm not sure it generalizes to all object types that the `axes` parameter could accept.  Note that the label actually has a grey background (i.e. it isn't transparent)

Not so advanced. People may copy-paste from the internets.
Why not setting the background of the _axis_ only to white or black? Advanced users will know how to revert it to another color if needed.

I honestly don't think that not handling figures with green background is a big drawback. But the rendering should be correct for default parameters at least.

Another compromise, different than the one above, is to remove the colored bounding box and move the labels a bit farther away from the brains, to avoid overlap in all reasonable cases.  

Indeed, I noticed that the padding of the bounding box is not very good above (note how the ""L"" touches the border of the brain), and in playing with that last night I settled this (bounding box still colored):

I agree it'd be nice to have better tests for plotting since at the moment we only have very limited smoke tests. I don't have a great suggestion for how to do that though. I meant to look at what matplotlib and seaborn was doing a while ago but I haven't got around to do it.

All of the plotting edge cases I'm looking at now, and things like print-to-PDF concerns, seems like important regression tests to verify before changing plotting code, but would slow down the Travis run.

There are other designs possible; for example, these types of tests could be implemented outside the `nosetests` framework.  That's just the way I've dealt with it in the past.  Very open to suggestions, but I do feel quite nervous changing plotting code without good regression tests to check that I'm not overlooking anything.

If they are not run on Travis, they will go under our radar when merging
pull request. So we need to find a way to have both good code coverage
and fast test suite. In my experience, it has always been possible,
though it sometime required work.

I am very worried that adding the option to override defaults is going
overboard in terms of complexity for little benefits. This is going to be
of interest to a absolutely tiny fraction of users and it brings more
code lines, and more ways of putting the plotting code in corner cases,
and thus forcing us to add even more complexity. I think that we must
limit the amount of customization: after all, it doesn't bring that much
to the average user, who wants to do simple analysis and plotting of
data.

Unless I'm misunderstanding, even if they're run on Travis, and somehow we can show the image output, we'd have to remember to manually check that they ""look good"".

I agree, but this capability is already there--all of these functions take `kwargs`.  In my (admittedly uncertain) testing, this didn't work well for the existing functionality.

My real reason for doing this was that the args passed to the `ax.text` function was duplicated for `L` and `R` labels, and they got out of sync (one was passed with `alpha`, the other was not).  In refactoring that code, I noticed that switching the order of where `kwargs` was added gave the opportunity to override.  No need to even mention it, but it's there.

> it brings more code lines

I believe it actually reduced the number of lines and chances for real bugs, as the parameters passed for setting text are consistent between ""L"" and ""R"" labels.  Duplicating that logic elsewhere for consistency added 1-2 lines in 2 other places, but it's either a wash or slightly shorter overall.

No biggie either way to me.

Can you submit a PR with only these lines. When I looked at the diff

Finding default that work well on all inputs is hard. You can always

Actually, that's probably a good idea. And that way we have edges going
to it in both plot (this needs to be documented in the docstrings of
add_marker and plot_connectome).

Right, but it's a fairly specific function. And I worry about having a

The 2 subsections have overlaps, and title that don't summarize what's in them. When teaching, I spend my time jumping from one to the other, which is an indication that it's not structured at all the right way.

Here is how I suggest to restructure:

I am doing this with pythontex, which automatically generates figures at the correct resolution and allows me to specify font sizes to match my document via [`matplotlibrc`](http://matplotlib.org/users/customizing.html).

Sadly this does not seem to affect the text size in the the aforementioned plotting function from nilearn. I assume this is because of some idiosyncrasy of the plotting which rasterizes the text behind the scenes. Do you know if this is the case? And more importantly, do you know how I can change the font size? Presentations have low resolution, so the text on my figures is disproportionally huge.

The display object you get back from the `plot_stat_map` call has a `title` method which you can pass the size into, so something like this should work:

``` python

display = plot_stat_map(...)
display.title('Your title', size=30)

```
display = plot_stat_map(...)
display.title('Your title', size=30)
```

this seems to add a _second_ title on top of the one I pass to the plotting function. It's a bit of a hack, but ok...

Setting the title with:

```
display = plot_stat_map(...,title=False)
display.title('Your title', size=30)
```

works, and setting the annotation font size with

```
display = plot_stat_map(...annotate=False)
display.annotate(size=30)
```

Works as well. Now, before I call this completely solved. Is there any way to set these sizes in the function call, or tweak them via one of the many `matplotlibrc` parameters? It's weird to have to explicitly not set stuff first, just to then be able to set it correctly with a separate call....

Use the lower-level commands, as you are already doing. The high-level

For the time being, I wrote [a short wrapper](https://github.com/TheChymera/chyMRI/blob/master/plotting.py#L51-L75) to allow `nilearn.plotting.plot_stat_map` plots to scale ~properly.

@lesteve I can't see any reason why anything using matplotlib should disregard `matplotlibrc`. And it's not just about slides, but about making the figures look _great_ at _any other_ dpi - not just that of a ""normal"" monitor.

There are forwarded to the imshow command.

It's not: routing the arguments to different underlying commands would be
incomprehensible, not to mention hard to implement.

Oh, this... You must know about memory_level, right? Well, this function will decide if the caching is activated or not.

`func_memory_level` is the `threshold` from which the caching must be activated. `memory_level` is the level selected by the used. If `memory_level` is above `func_memory_level` (or the opposite, I always mix it up), then caching is activated, otherwise it is not.
