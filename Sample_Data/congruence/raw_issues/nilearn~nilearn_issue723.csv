Not too bad, because if it's a 4D image, new_img_like doesn't call
'get_data', and so the data is not loaded.

That said, new_img_like is a bit of a tangle, as it uses load_img, which
itself uses new_img_like. new_img_like should probably not be using
load_img, and maybe nibabel directly.

Would you be OK to special-case new_img_like to use nibabel directly,
and, as a consequence, not load the data for list of string?

The reason that I am asking, is that I am wondering how much this pattern
can be reused. It's kinda specific.
