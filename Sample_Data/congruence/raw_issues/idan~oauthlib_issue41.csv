I've also made a second commit that replaces several assertTrue/assertFalse calls with more specific test methods. This second commit is completely optional, but it seemed an obvious improvement to make while I was there. This works when using cpython 2.7 or pypy 1.8 with or without unittest2 installed. I have not tested it with python 2.6, but I see no reason for it to fail as long as unittest2 is installed.

This is cleaner, and makes the tests not depend on dictionary
