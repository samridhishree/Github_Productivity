Because part of the documentation snippets are from examples scripts in examples and part of the other snippets are directly in the rst files (the one starting with the python promts `>>>`) it may well be the case that there is some mismatch between the two.

Of course PR are more than welcome on these documentation issues.

My guess: probably not although I haven't checked. I think the emphasis was more on restructuring than fixing bugs.
