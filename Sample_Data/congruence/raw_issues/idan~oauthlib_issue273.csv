I agree with informing the user / raising a fatal error if there are duplicate `client_id` and `redirect_uri` parameters. I suppose we could restrict it to when the duplicate parameters have mismatching values but fine with either or.

As for `scope`, `state` and `response_type` I reckon we can still return an error message back to the client (which at this point should have been confirmed valid along with the redirect url). 

I think that comes close to what the spec outline in 4.{1,2}.2.1

> If the request fails due to a missing, invalid, or mismatching
> redirection URI, or if the client identifier is missing or invalid,
> the authorization server SHOULD inform the resource owner of the
> error and MUST NOT automatically redirect the user-agent to the
> invalid redirection URI.
> 
> If the resource owner denies the access request or if the request
> fails for reasons other than a missing or invalid redirection URI,
> the authorization server informs the client by adding ...
