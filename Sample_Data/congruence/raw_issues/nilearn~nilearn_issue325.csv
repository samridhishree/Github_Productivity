<pre>
            thr = 1e-1 * vmax
            import copy
            slicer.add_contours(copy.deepcopy(this_img),
                               colors=[colors_light[color],
                                       colors_light[color], ],
                               levels=[-thr, thr],
                               #linestyles='dotted',
                               linewidths=1,
                               label=condition)

            thr = 5e-1 * vmax
            slicer.add_contours(this_img,
                               colors=[colors_light[color],
                                       colors_light[color], ],
                               levels=[-thr, thr],
                               linewidths=2,
                               label=condition)
</pre>


Without the 'deepcopy', the above doesn't seem to work.

``` python
from nilearn import datasets, plotting

dataset = datasets.fetch_localizer_contrasts(['checkerboard'], n_subjects=1, get_anats=True)

import nibabel
cmap_filename = dataset.cmaps[0]
img = nibabel.load(cmap_filename)
print 'original affine:\n', img.get_affine()

display = plotting.plot_anat(dataset.anats[0])
display.add_contours(img, levels=[-10, 10], colors=['y', 'g'])
print 'affine after first add_contour:\n', img.get_affine()
display.add_contours(img, levels=[-1, 1], colors=['r', 'c'])
print 'affine after second add_contour:\n', img.get_affine()

display = plotting.plot_anat(dataset.anats[0])
display.add_contours(cmap_filename, levels=[-10, 10], colors=['y', 'g'])
display.add_contours(cmap_filename, levels=[-1, 1], colors=['r', 'c'])
```

output:

```
original affine:
[[  -3.    0.    0.   78.]
 [   0.    3.    0. -111.]
 [   0.    0.    3.  -51.]
 [   0.    0.    0.    1.]]
affine after first add_contour:
[[  -3.    0.    0.  -78.]
 [   0.    3.    0. -111.]
 [   0.    0.    3.  -51.]
 [   0.    0.    0.    1.]]
affine after second add_contour:
[[  -3.    0.    0. -234.]
 [   0.    3.    0. -111.]
 [   0.    0.    3.  -51.]
