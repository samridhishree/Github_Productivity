There's a new version of [pytest](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest) available.
You are currently using **3.0.4**. I have updated it to **3.0.5**

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.0.5

>=====

>* Add warning when not passing ``option=value`` correctly to ``-o/--override-ini`` (`2105`_).
>  Also improved the help documentation. Thanks to `mbukatov`_ for the report and
>  `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Now ``--confcutdir`` and ``--junit-xml`` are properly validated if they are directories
>  and filenames, respectively (`2089`_ and `2078`_). Thanks to `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* Add hint to error message hinting possible missing ``__init__.py`` (`478`_). Thanks `DuncanBetts`_.

>* More accurately describe when fixture finalization occurs in documentation (`687`_). Thanks `DuncanBetts`_.

>* Provide ``:ref:`` targets for ``recwarn.rst`` so we can use intersphinx referencing.
>  Thanks to `dupuy`_ for the report and `lwm`_ for the PR.

>* In Python 2, use a simple ``+-`` ASCII string in the string representation of ``pytest.approx`` (for example ``&quot;4 +- 4.0e-06&quot;``)
>  because it is brittle to handle that in different contexts and representations internally in pytest
>  which can result in bugs such as `2111`_. In Python 3, the representation still uses ``Â±`` (for example ``4 Â± 4.0e-06``).
>  Thanks `kerrick-lyft`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Using ``item.Function``, ``item.Module``, etc., is now issuing deprecation warnings, prefer
>  ``pytest.Function``, ``pytest.Module``, etc., instead (`2034`_).
>  Thanks `nmundar`_ for the PR.

>* Fix error message using ``approx`` with complex numbers (`2082`_).
>  Thanks `adler-j`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Fixed false-positives warnings from assertion rewrite hook for modules imported more than
>  once by the ``pytest_plugins`` mechanism.
>  Thanks `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Remove an internal cache which could cause hooks from ``conftest.py`` files in
>  sub-directories to be called in other directories incorrectly (`2016`_).
>  Thanks `d-b-w`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Remove internal code meant to support earlier Python 3 versions that produced the side effect
>  of leaving ``None`` in ``sys.modules`` when expressions were evaluated by pytest (for example passing a condition
>  as a string to ``pytest.mark.skipif``)(`2103`_).
>  Thanks `jaraco`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Cope gracefully with a .pyc file with no matching .py file (`2038`_). Thanks
>  `nedbat`_.
