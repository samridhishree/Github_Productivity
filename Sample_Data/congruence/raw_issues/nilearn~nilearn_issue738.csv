The goal here is to establish a common basis for NiftiMasker, NiftiLabelsMasker and NiftiMapsMasker. There are a lot of advantages:
- NiftiMasker features come for free in Nifti*Maskers (sessions and sample masks)
- If we design it well, MultiNifti_Masker flavors will come for free for all Nifti_Maskers.
- Code is slightly more complicated (very slightly actually) but much smaller, making maintenance and bug tracking easier.

Steps done:
- [x] Make `filter_and_mask` rely on `filter_and_extract`
- [x] Make NiftiSpheresMasker rely on `filter_and_extract`
- [x] Make `BaseMasker` more generic. NiftiLabelsMasker and NiftiMapsMasker should inherit from it.
- [x] Make `MultiNiftiMasker` independant by inheriting `NiftiMasker`
