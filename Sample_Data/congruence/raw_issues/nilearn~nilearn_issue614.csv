Basically, it uses a proper zip iterator when using _iter_check_niimg, otherwise the list of niimg is precaclulated and the number of file descriptors (or memory) could explode.

Cannot create a reliable test for that.

Ping @mrahim @banilo could you validate that (don't try on drago since the number of fd allowed on it is now tremendous).
