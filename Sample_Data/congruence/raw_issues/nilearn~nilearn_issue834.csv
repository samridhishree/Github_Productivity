I was wondering whether we could not use a HTML redirect:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5411538/redirect-from-an-html-page

This way we could have a shorter URL that fits on one line, say something like `http://nilearn.github.io/building_block/niimg.html`, and additional level of indirection in case this part of the documentation moves around.

Anyone who want to give it a try, be my guest!
