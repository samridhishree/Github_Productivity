No, I think that I prefer the closing. Indeed, some of the inner
ventricles may appear as holes in a brain mask. That's a good thing.

+1 for the closing. Thanks Ronald.

"issue_comment","145","nilearn","nilearn","GaelVaroquaux","2013-12-05 19:37:07","From a very general standpoint, I am a bit worried by adding on more parameter, that non experts will not be able to set, especially since it is off by default.

This raises 2 questions:
- should it be on by default?
- can we merge it with the mask_opening, by saying that we do n openings, and (n-1) closings. Of course the name of the argument will have to be changed.

"issue_comment","145","nilearn","nilearn","rphlypo","2013-12-06 07:35:08","I do agree with the additional parameter being a little cumbersome, and I do agree that we could set the number of openings and closings equal to each other, as such uniting these in a single operation.

The closings are on by default if a `NiftiMasker` object is initiated, but are off by default in the lower level function `compute_epi_mask` (this choice for backward compatibility). If we integrate both `opening` and `closing` into a single parameter/operation, I assume this question is automatically dealt with.

+1 for a simplified user interface with a single parameter, merging `opening` and `closing` into a single operation.

OK, then we need to find a name for this parameter :)

Let's not bother about backward compatibility for a package that isn't
even released.

Actually, I would have thought that people would prefer to rely on anatomically derived masks, I order to keep only gm. Are there so many datasets without anatomy provided with functional data ? Or any other pb behind ?
