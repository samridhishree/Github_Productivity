A new [01](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac-01) version of the MAC token spec removes hashing of the body and possibly other things. The OAuth 2 draft is considered stable by now but I am uncertain if this is the case for MAC tokens too. 

**Update: The MAC token type is currently not maintained and considered incomplete. Might be better to let it stay on v.00 and wait until the mac token spec is picked up and approaching stable.**

"issue_comment","29","idan","oauthlib","lalinsky","2012-11-10 13:21:29","I'm interested in having a library that works with the 01 MAC tokens. The current code for 00 tokens doesn't really work:
- there is no standard way to pass the MAC key, etc.
- it uses non-existent functions (`utils.generate_nonce`, `utils.generate_timestamp`)
- the `nonce` parameter is constructed incorrectly, it should be `age:nonce`, but the code currently does `nonce:age`
- there is no way to specify the token issue time, so the code can't really generate the `age` component of the `nonce` parameter

Do you think it's useful to keep the 00 code and perhaps try to fix it? If I want to add 01 support, should I keep both?

"issue_comment","29","idan","oauthlib","ib-lundgren","2012-11-11 22:49:18","I noticed you added support for both, let's keep it that way until there is some more progress on the draft and then follow the latest draft. As far as I know none is currently working on the draft as they are lacking clear use cases for when to use MAC tokens. If you happen to have one I'm sure they would be very interested to hear about it =)

Should we update it or wait until the spec matures?

I'd say it's grown a bit in complexity since last with a few more fields in
the auth header. We could probably update but maybe hold off till there at
least is a full example?
