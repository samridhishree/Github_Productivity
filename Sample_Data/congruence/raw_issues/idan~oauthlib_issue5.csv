"issue_title","5","idan","oauthlib","ib-lundgren","2012-03-15 10:41:19","Added an equality test against an openssl generated signature. Copied the secrets from ""self"" and manually created the hmac key. Alternatively this could be generated from the self.client_secret & self.resource_owner_secret but then it should also run against openssl rather than use the hard coded signature. Felt that it was better to use a few statics string, what do you think?

"issue_comment","5","idan","oauthlib","dgouldin","2012-03-24 16:48:24","I'm -1 on moving string constants into test functions if they're used by multiple tests. While DRY doesn't really apply to testing as much, self. is clear enough here that duplication of the string feels unnecessary.

I'll accept the control_signature part if you'd like to split that out.
