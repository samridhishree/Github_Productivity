But I don't think that we want to ignore any files in the code coverage.
I am quite happy to see that it's reported that they are not covered.

I tentatively included all `__init__` files, but that's probably to aggressive.

With that said, I'll have no objections if this is closed; I just assumed others would feel the same!
