Supporting scikit-learn 0.10 was too expensive, and neurodebian means
that even old ubuntu install can easily get more recent versions.

No. It's a configuration that's 2 years old, and we felt that 2 years old
was a good time.

Agreed!

I need to be on the proper versions to test the `fix_warnings` PR (https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/371).  Are there any concerns with the versions used to test in this PR?

Thanks!
