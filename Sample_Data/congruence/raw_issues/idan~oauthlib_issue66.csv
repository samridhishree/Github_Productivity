"issue_comment","66","idan","oauthlib","ib-lundgren","2012-11-11 22:46:25","Great work! Not sure if there is much need for keeping support for both v00 and v01 around and since the fate of MAC tokens is still very much undecided, or at least that's how it has been for a while, not sure if someone picked up the ball as I'm lagging behind on the mailing list reading. However let's keep it for now and see how things turn out.
