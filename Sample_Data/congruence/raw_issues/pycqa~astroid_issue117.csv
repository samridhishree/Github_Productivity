There are a couple of syntactic changes to Python 3.5:
- the new @ (matmul) operator
- additional unpacking generalization
- async and await keywords

We do support 3.5 in astroid 1.4.0 for instance. There are some issues with the understanding of a couple of Python 3.5's features, but they can be considered separate of this (#201 and #202 for instance).

Hi Claudiu, when do you plan to release v1.4.0?

I don't know honestly. We have these 5 issues that blocks the release (https://bitbucket.org/logilab/astroid/issues?priority=blocker&status=open&status=new) but I didn't have enough time to tackle them. Could take a week or two or something like that.

Astroid is blocking our update to python3.5 in Fedora, any news with the release date?

It's still going to take some time to fix those blocker issues, since they require more architectural changes than a couple of fixes. But since the release it's taking too long, our plans is to start cherrypicking some features, including 3.5 support, into a new branch and release the new version from there. That's something that I plan to start doing this week and hopefully it will be done by next week. If I don't comeback with an answer until then, please ping me back.

I don't want to rush you or anything, but do you have some ETA for the python3.5 support release?

Thank you for the ping. I started to graft changesets from the default branch into a 1.4.0 branch (https://bitbucket.org/logilab/astroid/commits/branch/1.4.0) and hopefully I would finish this in the following days, together with pylint. I'm trying to have it finished by weekend.

I just released pylint 1.5.0, together with astroid 1.4.0. I'm extremely sorry for this delay, we'll try to have a better release schedule in place in order to avoid long-awaited releases such as this one.
