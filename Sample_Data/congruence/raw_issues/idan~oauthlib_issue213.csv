Essentially study http://jacobian.org/writing/great-documentation/ and see what is missing, could be clearer, restructured, etc. Do we have docs for beginners, intermediate, api etc everywhere?

There are examples / use cases that are missing. What comes to mind first are using non web app grant for providers and non web app clients, both OAuth 2. 

Also minor things like using env var DEBUG=1 to turn of HTTPS checking. Enabling logging to debug stuff on provider side etc.
