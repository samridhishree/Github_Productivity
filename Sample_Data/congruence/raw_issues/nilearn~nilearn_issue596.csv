This is useful when, for example, one wants to display multiple images on the same scale. I might be missing some other way to do this, but in any case, since the plotting functions pass kwargs to imshow, it's easy to do by setting the vmax. I wonder if this would be worth turning into an explicit argument in plotting calls? Users who aren't familiar with the imshow API might otherwise think there's no way to limit the range, and it seems important enough to make explicit. Maybe via a range argument that takes a tuple of (min, max)? Then min could simply be aliased to threshold and max to vmax.

Because this issue or something very related was raised here
https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/524
and adressed with this
https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/562

Could you check if the arguments appear when you update?

I was running an older version; after upgrading, vmax shows up in the explicit arg list. Thanks!

cool, glad it works! And thanks anyway for reporting!
