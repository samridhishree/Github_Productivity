``` Python
import nibabel
from nilearn import datasets, input_data
from nilearn.input_data.nifti_spheres_masker import _iter_signals_from_spheres
adhd = datasets.fetch_adhd(n_subjects=1)
func_filename = adhd.func[0]
seeds_masker = input_data.NiftiSpheresMasker([(-6, 50, -1)], radius=6.)
seeds_masker.fit()
sphere_timeseries = _iter_signals_from_spheres(
    seeds_masker.seeds_, nibabel.load(func_filename),
    seeds_masker.radius,
    seeds_masker.allow_overlap).next()
```

I also want to go from array to image using `inverse_transform` but I got an error

``` Python
image = seeds_masker.inverse_transform(sphere_timeseries.T)
```

OK I will take a look to see if it's not too hard for me :)

I looked into it this afternoon and it looks complex for me. May be I can try to work on #1229 to become familiar with the inverse_transform concept
