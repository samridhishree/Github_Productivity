I'd be happy to help push this forward.  I can take care of the merge conflicts and take care of the printing / verbose issues, for example.  I also think the coding of the `plot_haxby_rpbi` example could be simplified.    

I also had a couple of questions about analysis choices made in the `plot_haxby_rpbi` example.  I worry that my questions / concerns may be naive (I am still very new to neuroimaging analysis), but I will follow up with them in case they're questions others might have in learning from the examples.

Probably, but the extent depends on long range temporal interactions (which are typically drift components) that are difficult to quantify

> Is this really a concern in a block design (24s per stimulus, 12s of rest in-between)?

Drift cutoff in nipy GLM is set by default to a period of 128s. If the interactions are really that long, then this would be a concern. 

> Would this be (at least partially) alleviated by passing detrend=True in the mask?

Probably. But as mentioned elsewhere, this detrending needs to be done by chunks (as indicated by the `chunk` variable in the label data)

Thanks @eickenberg ; I can perhaps include some of that in the example (like the detrending in chunks), and a bit more in comments.  I also think the code can be cleaned up a bit (after working through the example for some of the RSA-focused work I'm doing).
