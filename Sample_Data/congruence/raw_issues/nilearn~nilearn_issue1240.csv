However, it makes very brittle and awkward input verification to accept both 4D and 4+1D data.

Hence, I suggest to create 2 new classes: MultiNiftiMapsMasker and MultiNiftiLabelsMasker that take 4+1D data. These could be chained into a ConnectivityMeasure and a supervised learning to get a full predictive pipeline.

What do people think?
