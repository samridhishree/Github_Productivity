![canica_plot_outside_anatomy](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1680079/4822837/83d74d70-5f47-11e4-8e07-75af211bdff7.png)

The other slices look ok AFAICT:
![canica_plot_0](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1680079/4822848/aeeda69e-5f47-11e4-9a7e-84fe630ad6a0.png)

To reproduce it:

```
$ ipython --matplotlib -i plot_canica_resting_state.py 
```

and then inside ipython:

``` python
plot_stat_map(nibabel.Nifti1Image(components_img.get_data()[..., 0],
                                  components_img.get_affine()),
              display_mode='z', cut_coords=[75])
```

Is that a known issue? Maybe the adhd dataset is not in the MNI space?

> Apparently, the data you use has been warped to MNI space. But there are at least three possible prolems 
> - There is not one MNI template, but several of them 
> - the quality of the registration to the MNI space depends on the used algorithm/software 
> - The EPI images may be distorted wrt the anatomical images. 
>   For all these reasons, the kind of offset that you describe is not unexpected.

According to the nilearn.datasets.load_mni152_template docstring it comes from FSL and I double-checked that they match (on my computer the FSL one is at /usr/share/data/fsl-mni152-templates/avg152T1_brain.nii.gz).

FWIW in the FSL [doc](http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/Atlases) it is called ""MNI152 standard-space T1-weighted average structural template image"".
