This allows to get the mean connectivity matrix when the outputs are vectorized as requested in #1236, without refitting of the estimator.

To know how to use ```mean_``` attribute for various kinds. Please see in a very good example examples/03_connectivity/plot_group_level_connectivity.py showing how to do this.","",""
