Hello,
testdata files (which are depending on the Python version) are installed all the time, so you end up with py3k specific file in a python2 installation dir and vice versa, and in distro (like Debian) byte-compiling python files are installation, it generates error:

```
#!python
Setting up python3-astroid (1.3.4-1) ...
  File ""/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/astroid/tests/testdata/python2/data/all.py"", line 7
    def func(): print 'yo'
                         ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

  File ""/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/astroid/tests/testdata/python2/data/module.py"", line 22
    print '!!!'
              ^
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'

  File ""/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/astroid/tests/testdata/python2/data/module2.py"", line 73
    assert `1`

```

and 

```

Yep, this would be nice to fix.
