For me moment, the function assumes the inputs are Nifti images, thus they contains numpy arrays. So normally, the formula should contains any function that can be applied on numpy arrays.

Something simple and different example which shows how to use this function on real Nifti images. So that user gets easy going taking this function.

Yes, you computed a ""Left - Right"" contrast, but in the paper, you want
to show a ""Right - Left"" contrast, to be consistent with the narration.
