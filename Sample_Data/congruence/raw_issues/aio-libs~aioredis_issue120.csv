It would be cool to have a `namespace` or `prefix` system.
Basically:

``` python
>> redis = yield from aioredis.create_redis(('localhost', 6379), namespace=""foo:"")
>> yield from redis.set('my-key', 'value')
```

would be equivalent to `SET foo:my-key value`.

What do you guys think about that?

This can be nice feature however it requires some changes in library design.
I'll keep it in mind.
