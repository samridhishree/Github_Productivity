It works when I manually resample the mask to the shape and affine of my functional image, but when using the masker reasmpling I am getting an error. May be I am doing something wrong with the `NiftiMasker` ?

``` Python
import nibabel
from nilearn import datasets, masking, input_data
icbm152 = datasets.fetch_icbm152_2009()
wm_filename = icbm152.wm
wm_mask_img = masking.compute_epi_mask(wm_filename, upper_cutoff=1.)
adhd = datasets.fetch_adhd(n_subjects=1)
func_img = nibabel.load(adhd.func[0])
target_shape, target_affine = func_img.get_data().shape[:-1], func_img.get_affine()
wm_masker = input_data.NiftiMasker(mask_img=wm_mask_img,
                                   target_shape=target_shape,
                                   target_affine=target_affine)
wm_signals = wm_masker.fit_transform(adhd.func[0])
```

throughs the following error

> ValueError: Given mask is not made of 2 values: [ -7.44326475e-15  -7.13535134e-15  -6.32653652e-15 ...,   6.93715918e-15

We should have a special function to resample a mask (ie binarize the values after resampling).
