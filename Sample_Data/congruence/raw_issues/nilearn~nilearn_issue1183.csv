In my example, this was obvious, as I have two clusters on the right and one on the left. This is with the old code:

For us it seems to happen when plotting an image of all zeros (we are plotting a sequence - on the first image with non-zero entries we get the switch to the correct layout).

That's pretty bad. I think that we need to do a bugfix release quite
fast.

 On the other hand I have not been able yet to reproduce consistently the case were the images are not inverted appropriately but this change should not affect that. Will keep looking.

It would be great if you give me a hand to figure out the bug source if I dont manage to find it this weekend.
