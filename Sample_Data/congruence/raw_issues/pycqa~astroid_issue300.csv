"issue_title","300","pycqa","astroid","PCManticore","2015-12-29 16:42:43","The builtins module is a bit special, since it's built all the time when astroid gets initialized. Currently, builtin_lookup rebuilds the module all the time it gets called, which isn't great for two reasons, one being performance wise, the second one being the fact that builtin_lookup needs building capabilities (ast_from_module), which creates a circular dependency between interpreter/lookup.py and whatever the place of ast_from_module will be. Having a method such as manager.get_builtins() will get rid of these problems.
