"issue_title","235","idan","oauthlib","whitechris969","2014-02-28 08:15:35","In the spec (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-2.2) it says that when you access the protected resource by including the token in the body (rather than the headers) you should only be able to do this through a PUT request, not GET. Also, there's a few other things. I'm able to do this:

```
response = requests.get(token_url,params={'grant_type':'client_credentials','client_id': client_id, 'client_secret': client_secret})
token = json.loads(response.text)
response = requests.get(api_url,params=token,headers={})
```

The important part being that I am putting the token in the body and issuing a GET request. Isn't this against the spec and shouldn't it fail?

"issue_comment","235","idan","oauthlib","ib-lundgren","2014-03-20 18:34:35","Yes it is against the spec and should fail or at least raise a warning. I don't think it is a security issue as much as GET requests should not have request bodies as they are usually ignored. Should still be fixed tho.

Thanks for reporting and investigating!
