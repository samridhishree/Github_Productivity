The functions concerned are those of ``numpy.core.ufunc`` module except those that have been imported through the file under numpy/lib/function_base.py. 
The module ``numpy.core.ufunc`` has no ``__all__`` members. 
The proposed solution is really not elegant but for now i don't see any other solution.
