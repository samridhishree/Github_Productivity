There's another builtin type in CPython 3.3+ called SimpleNamespace, exposed in types.  I think it's implemented in C but I'm not certain.  It's used for `sys.implementation`; I don't know if it's used anywhere else.  When something tries to import a module containing a SimpleNamespace instance, ast_from_object eventually finds the following definition in `types` and adds it as an AssignNode:

``` python
SimpleNamespace = type(sys.implementation)
```

However, since that `type` call doesn't point to anything inference can understand, it ultimately causes tests to fail.
