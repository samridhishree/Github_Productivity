- corrected grammatical errors
- added some information about the `percentile` value (range)  in both `image.high_variance_confounds` and `signal.high_variance_confounds`, since current documentation is contradictory

- default value of 2 percent of highest variance voxels for `percentile` in both `image.high_variance_confounds` and `signal.high_variance_confounds`, as to comply with the recommendations in the ComCor paper
