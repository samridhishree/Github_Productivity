# Astroid confused by an `openpyxl` property defined with a setter

One way to see the issue is to run `pylint`[1] with the following code:

```
#!python

import openpyxl
wb = openpyxl.Workbook()
sheet = workbook.get_active_sheet()
```

`sheet` has its type incorrectly detected as `int` rather than `Worksheet`. The definition of `Workbook` is as follows:

```
#!python

class Workbook(object):
    ...
    def get_active_sheet(self):
        return self.active

    @property
    def active(self):
        return self.worksheets[self._active_sheet_index]

    @active.setter
    def active(self, value):
        self._active_sheet_index = value
    ...
    def _read_workbook_settings(self, xml_source):
        ...
        self.active = int(view.attrib['activeTab'])

```

I think the fix would be to cut off the type inference propagation for properties defining a setter, and rely solely on the getter for type inference.

[1]: I think the bug is in `astroid`, but happy to post it on `pylint` if that's a better place for it
