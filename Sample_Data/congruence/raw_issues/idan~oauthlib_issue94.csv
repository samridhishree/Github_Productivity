```
client_key = self.dummy_client_key
```

Should we not be assigning these to the request object?

```
request.client_key = self.dummy_client_key
```

"issue_comment","94","idan","oauthlib","ib-lundgren","2013-01-15 20:40:40","Nicely spotted. It is indeed wrong that it is unused and yes it should be attached to the request. However to prevent leakage of sensitive credentials the secret keys should not be. I'd mention the need for improved testing in #95.

Feel free to send a PR if you have time, if not I'll get to it some time this week =)
