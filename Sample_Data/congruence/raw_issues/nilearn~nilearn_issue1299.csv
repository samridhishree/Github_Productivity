Given the usage that we make of this function, it may not be worth the risk.

I have trouble understanding on which behavior of nibabel we can rely or not. nibabel caching is evolving and becoming more and more cusomizable. I would not be surprised that a global option to disable it arise in a near future. Anyway I just thought that avoiding calling the same method twice in a row was good practice.
