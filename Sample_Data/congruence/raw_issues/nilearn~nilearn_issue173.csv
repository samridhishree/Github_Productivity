Two-sided tests equivalent to F-tests can still be performed (setting the `two_sided_test` argument to `True`). The example shows how to perform a one-sided test and the opposite test with one single call the permuted OLS (thus reducing the computation costs by two).

The unitary tests are a bit more tricky due to the absence of a simple function performing a massively univariate t_test in the presence of covariates.

I do find that line 200 of permuted_least_squares is not tested and to check this, you can replace it by something that raises an exception. The tests run fine. I really think that I'd like this to be tested, as I am worried that a fairly important behavior goes untested.

I heard Gael saying that scikit-learn's API for linear models was not optimal. Would it be improved to take 1 and 2 into account, I would be glad to simplify the current tests.
That said, I am aware we should not modify a general library such as scikit-learn to address the need of a more specific one (here nilearn). But, if it turns out that the use case involving 1 and 2 is more and more encountered, maybe it would be worth to have a discussion about it to be considered in scikit-learn.

This is really a nilearn question, not a scikit-learn question. Contrasts
have no meaning in scikit-learn. We are going to have to come up with our
own API here.

I advocate keeping the code simple for now by only considering t-test and see if this is enough for users.
