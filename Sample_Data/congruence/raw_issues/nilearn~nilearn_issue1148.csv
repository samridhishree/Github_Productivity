Sure, this is my top priority to look into. I might take some time to comment since I am new to look how backporting works in nilearn.

You may have to change title because your PR majorly addresses scikit-learn back ports.

If the question is whether check_array is the same as atleast2d_or_csr,
the answer is no: it does additional checks and should be prefered in
general.
