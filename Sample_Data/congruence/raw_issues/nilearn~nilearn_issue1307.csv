Working through the Tutorials currently on: 8.1.3. 3D and 4D niimgs: handling and visualizing. Seems like the line:

rsn = datasets.fetch_atlas_smith_2009()['rsn10']

Is not downloading the correct file- this download resulted in a 3KB file that cannot be opened in FSLview instead of a larger 4D file.

Upon later calling rsn with this command: print(image.load_img(rsn).shape) I receive the error below.

Thanks,
Aki

Most of the time, this error is due to the fact that the file was downloaded on a website that requires authentication. So, what is downloaded is the login page of the network. You can check that by opening the file with your favorite text editor.

Let me know if it is the case. If so, I will add a check in Nilearn to circumvent it.
