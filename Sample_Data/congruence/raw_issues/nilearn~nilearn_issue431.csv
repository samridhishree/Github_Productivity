I started testing the plotting tools which seem very cool but ran into an issue when trying to overlay my statistical maps which are all 4D images (with the 4th dimension being different tests). I am wondering if there are plans to support slicing in loaded 4D images in the future - dumping each file to 3D individually is possible but seems a bit cumbersome.

Best,
Seb

There are a few examples using index_img and iter_img. 

```
$ git grep -lP 'index_img|iter_img' examples/
examples/connectivity/plot_canica_resting_state.py
examples/connectivity/plot_ica_resting_state.py
examples/decoding/plot_haxby_searchlight.py
examples/manipulating_visualizing/plot_mask_computation.py
examples/plot_nifti_simple.py
```

Are you saying we should add something like this in a simpler example for example the plot_nilearn_101.py one?

@surchs you are more than welcome to put together an example showing how to plot 4d images with index_img and possibly iter_img.

It should go in examples/manipulating_visualizing and you can use datasets.fetch_nyu_rest (as in examples/plot_nifti_simple.py) to have a 4d image that you can then slice.
