It seems that in the example http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_adhd_spheres.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-03-connectivity-plot-adhd-spheres-py

the t_r is set to 2.5 seconds at masking. The time series’ header says tr = 2.0 s. Is the header wrong, or the example?

More generally, signal.clean has a t_r default value of 2.5. It would be more intuitive for the default to be None, and if no t_r is provided, it is fetched from the header. 
@GaelVaroquaux’s point on this: since the header info is often wrong, it would be best to set the default to None, and in the  case of bandpass filtering without explicitly providing a t_r raise an error and print the header t_r with a word of caution that the header info might be wrong.

TR is depending on how the data was acquired, and varies between experiments. A default value of None to me makes more sense than a default of 2.5 sec.
