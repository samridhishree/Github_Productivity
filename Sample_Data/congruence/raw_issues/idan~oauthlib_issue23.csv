The two changes I needed to make were:
1. Order of values returned from client.sign() were changed
2. Call to `Client.get_oauth_signature()` in `Server.check_request_signature()` needed to take a Request() instance.

I don't think the signature needs to change to `Request.__init__()`, I just wasn't sure if the way I was doing things was the right way to do it, or the way it was planning to stay.
