Right now, only the `tar.gz` file is being distributed on PyPI for [oauthlib](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/oauthlib), which isn't _that much_ of an issue, but it does add some time to installing the package.

This package should be compatible with the Wheel format, considering it doesn't appear to have any C dependencies and it is compatible with both Python 2 and 3. As a result, you should only need to generate a universal wheel and then everyone (on all systems) will get the ability to install oauthlib with just the wheel, without having to do any extra work.
