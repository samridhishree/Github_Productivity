plot_roi used for plotting a mask or plot_stat_map for mean image for
haxby2001 subjects.
Since these are not normalized to MNI, the effect of plotting the MNI
template behind is jarring.

I agree with the fact that a user who knows what the are doing will
investigate. But last week's experience showed that many don't and instead
of using the provided anat as background just continue working with the mni
template and comment on the fact that this is wrongly aligned ...

No clear opinion unfortunately.

And that user should be frightened, unless he or she knows what they are
doing.

No. They can say 'bg_img=False'. But I'd rather have thing explicite.

Beside, users should be aware of whether there images are in template
space or not. And the default of nilearn is to work in template space.

But, the bottom line is that a user plots and image without specifying a background image and it all looks ugly, because of a mis-aligned bg which was forced into the fig by [us] developers. It's not good for user experience, irrespective of whether the users know what they're doing or not.

I don't see the point having a default value, if it makes the figure look uglier --by default.

Do you really think that simply renaming that argument would solve the
problem? ""bg_img"" is really not clear to people?

Also, it's the second argument in the list of arguments. I really makes
me think that the users just didn't look at the docstring.

Having people read and understand the docs is challenging, but that's
what we need to be doing. When I teach, I keep coming back to the
documentation and showing people how to read it.

There are many options in the function, and it can be hard to read the
docstring. In addition, the docstrings didn't mention turning off the
background. I've pushed a couple of improvements. Minor, improvement, but
experience shows that even minor improvements help.

Right, and that's exactly where we should be taking this as an
opportunity to comment on the fact that it is not in template space, and
that this can be very dangerous. Indeed, all the atlases are in template
space. The coordinates that they pick up in papers are in template space.
At Neurospin, a significant fraction of the signal quality problems that
I have to deal with are about people who haven't done their registration
well.

@dohmatob says:

It's unglier only when users are work on non group-normalized data, which
is actually a rare case. There is only one dataset in nilearn that
display this behavior, and it's the Habxy one. It's a bit unlucky that we
are using this example as an introduction for everything, not only
because of the fact that it is in subject space, but also because
decoding is typically done on beta maps, and not on raw time series.

Finally, making a ""magic"" option to try to solve that problem is a very
bad idea. In addition to hidding something that users should be aware of,
that magic is going to fail sometimes, when the heuristics fail, and
users are going to be even more surprised. Magic options give to a
library a feeling that it is surprising and cannot be trusted. They need
to be avoided.
