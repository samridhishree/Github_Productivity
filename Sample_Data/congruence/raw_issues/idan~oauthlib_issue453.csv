As discussed in #339, this is not make sense for public clients. However, in that case, the public client should still be checked that is infact a public client (`authenticate_client_id`).

I also fixed a what appears to be a bad merge (`test_revoke_token_without_client_authentication` was defined twice), which is why the diff is a little messy.","start issue","Public clients should be validated when revoking tokens"
