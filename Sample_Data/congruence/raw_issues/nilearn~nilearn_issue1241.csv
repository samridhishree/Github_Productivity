We could add an option ('compute_confounds'), that would be one of {None, 'global_signal', 'compcor_5', 'compcor_10'} to do this during the transform in the various maskers. It would very much simplify this common usecase.

What do people think?

Well, I'll want compcorr more than global-mean because global mean is a
very stupid idea (makes the covariance matrix ill-conditionned by
construction), and it's a pity that the community has not realized it.

I agree. And that's why these things should not be on by default. But,
because they rely only on fMRI data, they are orders of magnitude easier
to use. Hence there is value to using them.

And motion + statistical compcor is not _always_ worse than only motion.
Only when the data is not very noisy.

That's much harder to do. It's not a problem that we can fix, in the
current state of things.

If BIDS preprocessed data (a standard for sharing preprocessed data)
becomes a success and is widely used, then we'll be able to tackle this
problem.

None.

Yes I agree, but people use default things, and I would prefer they are perfect, so that we push people to have good quality data, good preprocessing pipeline. In the same spirit we push them to use mathematically rigorous estimators.
Preprocessing is very important for me, I don't like the idea of ""Come on, don't car about it, with 1000 subjects we will not see the effect"" ;)

I would prefer to have a possibility to enter my WM and CSF masks, and have an anatomical CompCor

Do you want to do this as separate function as reported in #1104  or included in masker API ?
If it is a function, I am ready with it but needs some good wording. EDITED: I meant doc

It should not be a problem I think. we can do both ?
