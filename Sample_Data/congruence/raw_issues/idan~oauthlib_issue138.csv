```
""...If invalid then immediately fail the request by returning False. If the
nonce/timestamp pair has been used before and you may just have detected
a replay attack. Therefore it is an essential part of OAuth security that you
not allow nonce/timestamp reuse"".
```

However, the sample code returns True if a Nonce with given parameters is found. Wouldn't this indicate a possible replay attack? Or have I misunderstood something?

The sample code:

``` python
nonces_and_timestamps_database = [
   (u'foo', 1234567890, u'rannoMstrInghere', u'bar')
]

def validate_timestamp_and_nonce(self, client_key, timestamp, nonce,
   request_token=None, access_token=None):

   return ((client_key, timestamp, nonce, request_token or access_token)
            in self.nonces_and_timestamps_database)
```
