I find some of them quite useful. Do you think it would be interesting to add them in nilearn?

(Here they are with they lightness represented in grayscale below)

The only reason that we have colormaps in nilearn is because we needed bivalued colormaps with black in the center. Maybe we should ask matplotlib if they are interested in having these, and we could move them upstream.
