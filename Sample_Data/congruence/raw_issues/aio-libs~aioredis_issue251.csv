There's a new version of [pytest-xdist](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-xdist) available.
You are currently using **1.16.0**. I have updated it to **1.17.1**

### Changelog
> 
>### 1.17.0

>------

>- fix 124: xdist would mark test as complete after &#39;call&#39; step. As a result,
>  xdist could identify the wrong test as failing when test crashes at teardown.
>  To address this issue, xdist now marks test as complete at teardown.
