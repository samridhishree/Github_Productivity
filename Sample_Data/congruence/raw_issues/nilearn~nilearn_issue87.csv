If it is an activation map, we want a different heuristic, such as 'threshold', where the mask is given by the values that are above mask_lower_cutoff.

I think that we should introduce yet another option 'mask_strategy' that could be 'epi', for the current behavior, or 'threshold', and maybe later other options.

ADHD normalized is EPI. The mask computation heuristic for EPI should
work. If it doesn't we need to debug it.
