It would be great if adding OAuth 2 was this simple but unfortunately it is not. OAuth 2 differs significantly from OAuth 1, ie. no signing of request, no signature types or methods. Instead the burden of security responsibility is largely dumped onto SSL making room for a plethora of client profiles, authorization flows and token types. Therefore, rather than enjoying getting some nice crypto work done correctly as with OAuth1 the focus has shifted to designing an appealing and extensible interface, since under the hood there is not that much work to be done by OAuth 2 clients. 

Your pull request booted me into starting a discussion on the topic, feel free to join in =) #44
