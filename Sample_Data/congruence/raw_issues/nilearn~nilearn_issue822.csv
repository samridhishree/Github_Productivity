We should detect that ""idx"" is empty in _crop_mask and raise a more comprehensible error: something like ""Empty mask: if you have given a mask, it is empty, and if you have not given a mask, the mask-extraction routines have fail. Please provide an appropriate mask"".

@dohmatob : do you want to take care of that?

For @Leo-YF-Liu's particular example, 100% of standard brain = 0.044438533900526642% of **this** brain, leading to an essentially empty mask.

I think it's more natural to let `screening_percentile=100` mean 100% of **this** brain, i.e full-brain. Users can more easily make sense out of this.

With the data and the script that you shared, I am no longer getting an

Are you sure that you are indeed running the latest code? How did you do
the update?

Can you paste the output of the run, with eventual warnings and the
corresponding traceback?

Awesome! That's good news.

Well, interacting with you was useful, as it revealed a bug in our code,
and that before we released it to the public. Thanks a lot for the
detailed information.

I hope that you get good results with nilearn.
