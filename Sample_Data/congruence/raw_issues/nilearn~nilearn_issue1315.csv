abs_data = np.abs(data)
data_90 = np.percentile(abs_data, 90)
data_50 = np.median(abs_data)
levels = [data_90, data_50, -data_50, -data_90]

I am not feeling well today so I decided to go back home. Unfortunately, I will not get to see you again today. It was very nice to meet you. Thank you for your help! I wish you a great conference but an even greater holiday with your family.

Kind regards, Charlotte

Good point. Plots looks surprising. It is not failing with error but fails drastically in finding correct levels leading to masking out entire background.
For example,

We give two values through the `levels`parameter which corresponds to the thresholds of the contour we want to draw: One is positive and the other one is negative. We give a list of colors as parameter to associate a different color to each contour. Additionally, we plot them with thick line widths: We give only one value so that it is used for both contours.
