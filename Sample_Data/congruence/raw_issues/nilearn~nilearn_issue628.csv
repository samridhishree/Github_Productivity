``` python
import numpy as np
from nilearn import signal


n_samples = 10
n_features = 50
data = np.random.random((n_samples, n_features))

n_confounds = 6
confounds = np.random.random((n_samples, n_confounds))

confounds_file = 'tmp.csv'
np.savetxt(confounds_file, confounds, delimiter=',')

signal.clean(data, confounds=confounds_file)
```

The problem here is that the file is given to np.genfromtxt which interpret each line as a nan and therefore thinks that the first line is a header and remove it. We should use a more clever heuristic and also maybe try to find a more flexible way to load CSV files.
