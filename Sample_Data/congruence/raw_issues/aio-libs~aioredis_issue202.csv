There's a new version of [pytest](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest) available.
You are currently using **3.0.6**. I have updated it to **3.0.7**

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.0.7

>==================


>* Fix issue in assertion rewriting breaking due to modules silently discarding
>  other modules when importing fails
>  Notably, importing the `anydbm` module is fixed. (`2248`_).
>  Thanks `pfhayes`_ for the PR.

>* junitxml: Fix problematic case where system-out tag occured twice per testcase
>  element in the XML report. Thanks `kkoukiou`_ for the PR.

>* Fix regression, pytest now skips unittest correctly if run with ``--pdb``
>  (`2137`_). Thanks to `gst`_ for the report and `mbyt`_ for the PR.

>* Ignore exceptions raised from descriptors (e.g. properties) during Python test collection (`2234`_).
>  Thanks to `bluetech`_.
>  
>* ``--override-ini`` now correctly overrides some fundamental options like ``python_files`` (`2238`_).
>  Thanks `sirex`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.

>* Replace ``raise StopIteration`` usages in the code by simple ``returns`` to finish generators, in accordance to `PEP-479`_ (`2160`_).
>  Thanks `tgoodlet`_ for the report and `nicoddemus`_ for the PR.
>  
>* Fix internal errors when an unprintable ``AssertionError`` is raised inside a test.
>  Thanks `omerhadari`_ for the PR.

>* Skipping plugin now also works with test items generated by custom collectors (`2231`_).
>  Thanks to `vidartf`_.

>* Fix trailing whitespace in console output if no .ini file presented (`2281`_). Thanks `fbjorn`_ for the PR.

>* Conditionless ``xfail`` markers no longer rely on the underlying test item
>  being an instance of ``PyobjMixin``, and can therefore apply to tests not
>  collected by the built-in python test collector. Thanks `barneygale`_ for the
>  PR.
