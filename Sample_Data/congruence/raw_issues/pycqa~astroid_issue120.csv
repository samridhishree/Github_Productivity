.root() should guarantee that what it returns is a module. Unfortunately, I found a couple of cases, which involved transforms, where .root() return classes instead of modules. We should raise an error in that case (and probably we should fix whatever was returning a class to return a module instead).

Actually this can happen if the tree was spliced from another and it is in the course of being transformed.
