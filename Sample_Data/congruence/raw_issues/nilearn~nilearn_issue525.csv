I have encountered a bit of a weird bug.
Running
`from nilearn import plotting`
triggers

```

```

Not sure what is happening, since pl is defined right at the start. However, if I run the same command again in the same shell, I get a different error:

```

So far, I have tried updating nilearn and matplotlib but still have the same error. Any ideas?

Could you run that in a terminal: `python -c 'import pylab'`. My guess is that you don't have pylab installed. The problem is that we are not supposed to depend on pylab but matplotlib only. @lesteve do you know why we have pylab stuff here?

No reason other than historical ones I reckon, it'd be good to change `import pylab` by `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` which is probably recommended anyway.
