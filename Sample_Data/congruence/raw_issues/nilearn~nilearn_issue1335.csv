It would be good if we could try to be as close as possible to the structure of the other atlases that we are downloading. In particular, it would be good if the maps that are most likely to be used would be in a key called ""maps"", as in the other atlases, and the labels in a list given the corresponding labels in the order of the maps. You would have to give names to maps, rather than networks, but that should be easy, for instance ""Default-Mode_50"", .... You would need to add a list of networks labels too. The names of the other maps could then use a similar terminology, such as ""unthresh_maps"""", and ""networks_maps"".

The msdl atlas, for instance, exposes this structure. In the beginning, we weren't very good at imposing this structure, but while teaching we saw that it led to unneeded conceptual difficulties for the users.","5b968b86d24fd1c5d1267caebf3f78dfdbff3013","(None, '', u'nilearn/datasets/atlas.py')"
