If the original website for ADHD for example does not provide a preprocessed version of the data (http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200/index.html), then it might be worth it pointing out in the `description` where the actually obtained variant of the open dataset came from (Neurobureau in this case?, http://neurobureau.projects.nitrc.org/ADHD200/Data.html, is it Athena, Burner, NIAK, CIVET).

The [group ICA example](http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_canica_resting_state.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-03-connectivity-plot-canica-resting-state-py) apply CanICA on all 40 subjects in this ADHD dataset. 

Is that okay to do so without normalization?
