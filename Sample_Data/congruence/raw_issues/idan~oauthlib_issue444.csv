I would like to let the requesting oauth2 client know that the user clicked on 'denied' by redirecting to the callback with an `access_denied` error. Is there a way to do this?

Right now, I manually construct a `Request`, throw an `AccessDenied` error, and use it to construct the redirect URI, but this is ugly.","start issue","Let OAuth2 client know when user denies access"
