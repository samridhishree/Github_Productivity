In fact, I've put these parameters as None by default in the butterworth function and, as they were passed as ""False"", they were considered as 0 and bugs raised.

I've changed it to None to avoid this bug in the future.

+1. This is a useful feature.

How are you suggesting that it should be implemented? A list of path
separated by colons (':'), as with other path variables? I am ok with
this, but it should be well documented. Adding features is not useful if
users cannot find them.
