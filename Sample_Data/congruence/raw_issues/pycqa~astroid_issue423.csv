Can we have a test case that shows an issue and confirms that fix actually works?","",""

The result of the conversation was that the original AST was malformed, since it's not possible to have an assign statement as a base class of the node (as this patch might suggest). I'm closing this one.","",""

If a class is derived from a base class that had been assigned to elsewhere in
the code, _is_metaclass will see an AssignAttr or an AssignName as an
inferred baseobj. These don't have qname(), so we use the first assigned
value as the baseobj instead.","09b10aa61f1bc585fac708e74347ed62078649d6",""
