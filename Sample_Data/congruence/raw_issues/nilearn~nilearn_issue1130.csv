`mask_filename = haxby_dataset.mask`
`nifti_masker = NiftiMasker(mask_img=mask_filename, standardize=True)`
`func_filename = haxby_dataset.func[0]`
`X = nifti_masker.fit_transform(func_filename)`
`X = X[condition_mask]`

with eventually a change in the name of the mask variables just to make it clear that they're different from those used at the beginning of the section. The _y_ variable can just be replaced with the _target_ variable declared before.

The idea of this section being that more focussed on how to do feature selection procedure providing an idea. For me, I think user will know the meaning of X and y in fit and predict (as it explained above).

Thanks for spotting. PR welcome. :)
