I was trying to plot a statmap using`plt.plot_glass_brain()`and using `vmin` and `vmax` parameters to force range the colorbar between 2 given values. `vmax` works fine, but I could not make the colorbar's lower values to adapt to `vmin` 's values (should I open an issue?). I came to the source and spotted this small bug, which has no relation with my first problem, but I think it was fine to solve. 

thanks!
