Is there anything I can do to help or at least get a workaround so everybody can get a working oauth2 flow doing between an identity server and its client app?

I'm actually one of the ones trying to get an app built, and I'm unable to get even a simple oauth2 demo working using @lepture  flask-oauth and oauthlib and all I can find in google are the issues referenced above.  Its been very frustrating.  Anything I can do to get a fix so we can get oauth working again, please just let me know.","",""
