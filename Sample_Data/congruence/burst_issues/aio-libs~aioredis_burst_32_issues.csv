There's a new version of [pytest-xdist](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-xdist) available.
You are currently using **1.16.0**. I have updated it to **1.17.1**

### Changelog
> 
>### 1.17.0

>------

>- fix 124: xdist would mark test as complete after &#39;call&#39; step. As a result,
>  xdist could identify the wrong test as failing when test crashes at teardown.
>  To address this issue, xdist now marks test as complete at teardown.

There's a new version of [pytest](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest) available.
You are currently using **3.1.0**. I have updated it to **3.1.2**

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.1.2

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Required options added via ``pytest_addoption`` will no longer prevent using
>  --help without passing them. (1999)

>- Respect ``python_files`` in assertion rewriting. (2121)

>- Fix recursion error detection when frames in the traceback contain objects
>  that can&#39;t be compared (like ``numpy`` arrays). (2459)

>- ``UnicodeWarning`` is issued from the internal pytest warnings plugin only
>  when the message contains non-ascii unicode (Python 2 only). (2463)

>- Added a workaround for Python 3.6 WindowsConsoleIO breaking due to Pytests&#39;s
>  FDCapture. Other code using console handles might still be affected by the
>  very same issue and might require further workarounds/fixes, i.e. colorama.
>  (2467)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Fix internal API links to ``pluggy`` objects. (2331)

>- Make it clear that ``pytest.xfail`` stops test execution at the calling point
>  and improve overall flow of the ``skipping`` docs. (810)




>### 3.1.1

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- pytest warning capture no longer overrides existing warning filters. The
>  previous behaviour would override all filters and caused regressions in test
>  suites which configure warning filters to match their needs. Note that as a
>  side-effect of this is that ``DeprecationWarning`` and
>  ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` are no longer shown by default. (2430)

>- Fix issue with non-ascii contents in doctest text files. (2434)

>- Fix encoding errors for unicode warnings in Python 2. (2436)

>- ``pytest.deprecated_call`` now captures ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` in
>  context manager form. (2441)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Addition of towncrier for changelog management. (2390)

>### 1.6b3


>* 3588: No compact (p tag) html output in the i18n document build even when

>* The ``make latexpdf`` from 1.6b1 (for GNU/Linux and Mac OS, using

>  instead (as Sphinx does since 1.5.)
>* ``Sphinx.status_iterator()`` and ``Sphinx.old_status_iterator()`` is now
>  deprecated.  Please use ``sphinx.util:status_iterator()`` instead.
>* ``Sphinx._directive_helper()`` is deprecated. Please use
>  ``sphinx.util.docutils.directive_helper()`` instead.
>* ``BuildEnvironment.set_warnfunc()`` is now deprecated

There's a new version of [pytest](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest) available.
You are currently using **3.1.0**. I have updated it to **3.1.2**

### Changelog
> 
>### 3.1.2

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- Required options added via ``pytest_addoption`` will no longer prevent using
>  --help without passing them. (1999)

>- Respect ``python_files`` in assertion rewriting. (2121)

>- Fix recursion error detection when frames in the traceback contain objects
>  that can&#39;t be compared (like ``numpy`` arrays). (2459)

>- ``UnicodeWarning`` is issued from the internal pytest warnings plugin only
>  when the message contains non-ascii unicode (Python 2 only). (2463)

>- Added a workaround for Python 3.6 WindowsConsoleIO breaking due to Pytests&#39;s
>  FDCapture. Other code using console handles might still be affected by the
>  very same issue and might require further workarounds/fixes, i.e. colorama.
>  (2467)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Fix internal API links to ``pluggy`` objects. (2331)

>- Make it clear that ``pytest.xfail`` stops test execution at the calling point
>  and improve overall flow of the ``skipping`` docs. (810)




>### 3.1.1

>=========================

>Bug Fixes
>---------

>- pytest warning capture no longer overrides existing warning filters. The
>  previous behaviour would override all filters and caused regressions in test
>  suites which configure warning filters to match their needs. Note that as a
>  side-effect of this is that ``DeprecationWarning`` and
>  ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` are no longer shown by default. (2430)

>- Fix issue with non-ascii contents in doctest text files. (2434)

>- Fix encoding errors for unicode warnings in Python 2. (2436)

>- ``pytest.deprecated_call`` now captures ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` in
>  context manager form. (2441)


>Improved Documentation
>----------------------

>- Addition of towncrier for changelog management. (2390)
