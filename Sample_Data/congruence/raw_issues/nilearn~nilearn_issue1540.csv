Those changes should be reverted to normal after new version in matplotlib is released.

On top of that, one of the environment in AppVeyor Python 3.4.3 has conflict issues with new matplotlib. We should think of moving to Python 3.5.x
For instance, see failure in https://ci.appveyor.com/project/nilearn-ci/nilearn/build/1.0.2109/job/a4pfv1rqeish94x6","start issue","Revert changes in all CIs after matplotlib 2.1.1 is released"
