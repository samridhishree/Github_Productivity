- makes 5 items per row (changeable if necessary)
- Hovering docstring tooltips added

I'd like @AlexandreAbraham to have a look, and if you could address my minor comment it would be great. But beyond that, I am :+1: for merge, and super positive about the result.

No other comment on the rendering: it's far more better than the previous one.

Ideally, there should be a test of files modification date (if the script is newer than the image, re-run it, otherwise keep the already computed image). Have you tested that these lines are superfluous ?

I think that HTML 5 introduce a way to store custom data (throught the data-\* fileds) but otherwise, this may cause trouble. Hace you tried it on older browsers ?

At least, renaming it `data-tooltip` has to be done, so we are HTML 5 compliant. At best, I think that we could use an existing unused tag like `title`.
