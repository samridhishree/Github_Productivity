I am trying to create mask and apply it to a T1 image (just for check it is correct) and I having problems,

Here is the code with the error:


fmri_gm_norm = '/home/brain/Downloads/Audrey_Vanhaudenhuise/T1/mni_icbm152_gm_tal_nlin_sym_09a.nii'
T1 = '/home/brain/Downloads/Audrey_Vanhaudenhuise/T1/T1.nii'

# Creating the mask
from nilearn.input_data import NiftiMasker
masker = NiftiMasker(mask_strategy='epi',
                     mask_args=dict(upper_cutoff=.9, lower_cutoff=.4,
                                    opening=False))                                   
masker.fit()


## Applying the mask to T1
T1_masked = masker.transform(T1)

"issue_comment","1438","nilearn","nilearn","KamalakerDadi","2017-04-10 19:56:14","You should be using like this:
Step 1: I am trying to create mask

```python
fmri_gm_norm = '/home/brain/Downloads/Audrey_Vanhaudenhuise/T1/mni_icbm152_gm_tal_nlin_sym_09a.nii'
T1 = '/home/brain/Downloads/Audrey_Vanhaudenhuise/T1/T1.nii'

from nilearn.input_data import NiftiMasker
masker = NiftiMasker(mask_strategy='epi',
mask_args=dict(upper_cutoff=.9, lower_cutoff=.4,
opening=False))
masker.fit(fmri_gm_norm)
```
Step 2: and apply it to a T1 image
```python
# You should `fit` your mask image first and then should be using to transform
# your T1.

data = masker.transform(T1) 
```

Hope this helps.
