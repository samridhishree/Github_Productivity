"issue_comment","574","nilearn","nilearn","KamalakerDadi","2015-05-07 10:44:07","Example changes:

``` python
# Now add as an overlay the maps for the ACC and the left and right
# parietal nodes
display.add_overlay(image.index_img(atlas_filename, 5),
                    cmap=plotting.cm.black_blue)
display.add_overlay(image.index_img(atlas_filename, 6),
                    cmap=plotting.cm.black_green)
display.add_overlay(image.index_img(atlas_filename, 3),
                    cmap=plotting.cm.black_pink)

plt.show()
```

Basically removed vmin and vmax arguments.

For this, changed add_overlay codebase in displays.py

``` python
if 'vmin' not in kwargs:
            kwargs['vmin'] = np.ma.min([d.min() for d in data_2d_list
                                                         if d is not None])
        if 'vmax' not in kwargs:
            kwargs['vmax'] = np.ma.max([d.max() for d in data_2d_list
                                                          if d is not None])
```
