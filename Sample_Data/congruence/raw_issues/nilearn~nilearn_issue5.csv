I am testing the fix, but as the download takes a while, I am not sure that my fix is correct.

Before I scrap my work by pulling from your branch, I'd like to be really sure that it fixes the problem.

On top of this, the fact that you committed in your master branch will make history management a bit convoluted.

My fix, when trying to uncompress a dataset, will download again an archive if it is corrupted.

Sorry for messing up with git but I am not very familiar with several people working on several branches. Do you want me to move the commit to another branch ?
