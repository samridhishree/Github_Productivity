This is problematic because in this case an unaware user can pass an int n as the argument and run  `haxby_dataset.func[0]`, which will return data for subject 1 instead of subject n. It seems to me that we should either:
- Make this use case explicit in the docstring or;
- Throw an error when `subjects` is an int.
