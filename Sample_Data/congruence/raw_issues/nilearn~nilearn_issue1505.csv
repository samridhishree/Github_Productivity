This is what I was trying to do:

`from nilearn.plotting import plot_anat`
`plot_anat(filename)`

This is the error I am getting.

When I open the same file using MIPAV, I have no issues.

Does this look like a bug in nilearn or am I missing something.

I have attached the file I was using.

check first that you have the latest version of nibabel.

```python

This way this doesn't look like a bug. Because people at Nibabel are already aware of this case, I don't think reporting it again would be helpful.

Anyway, thanks for the help.","",""
