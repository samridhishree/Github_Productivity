What approach to making this change would work best for you? I think having the redirection in the location cleaner maps to an actual response than dedicating one of the return values to the redirect URI and would be a better approach moving forward.

@squirly yes oauthlib is not stable but rather not break libraries out of the blue so will need to roll this out with some caution.

I think I would agree with @squirly

Totally agree

Integration with django-oauth-toolkit should be straightforward!

Thanks for your work guys
