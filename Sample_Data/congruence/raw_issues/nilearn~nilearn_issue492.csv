I can see that.

I scikit-learn, the way we have it set up, it adds a report to the PRs,
like travis, which is awesome. It would be great if someone could port
that to nilearn.

I think it should be set-up for nilearn too. It doesn't seem to be working very well for scikit-learn at the moment though https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4372#issuecomment-78054010 ...

From a little bit of reading it looks like:
1. the landscape report is done as a comment. When the same thing was enabled for coveralls, people were pretty annoyed by the automatic emails that ensued each time somebody pushed into a PR branch.
2. there is a landscape.io github [issue](https://github.com/landscapeio/landscape-issues/issues/108) about using the github status API which is far less intrusive but not sure how likely this is going to happen in the near future.

OK, let's wait then.

Thanks for letting us know. FWIW the bot comments have been disabled for nilearn a few days ago.
