1. Have Pylint (1.6.4) evaluate the following snippet:
   
   ``` python
   class prop(object):
       def __init__(self, fn):
           self.value = 5
   
   class my_class(object):
       @prop
       def my_property(self):
           pass
   
   print(my_class().my_property.value)
   ```
### Current behavior

Pylint returns the following, even with `prop` added to `property_classes`:
    `E: 10, 6: Method 'my_property' has no 'value' member (no-member)`
### Expected behavior

No `no-member` errors. A decorated function should not be assumed to be a function.
### `python -c ""from astroid import __pkginfo__; print(__pkginfo__.version)""` output

1.4.8
