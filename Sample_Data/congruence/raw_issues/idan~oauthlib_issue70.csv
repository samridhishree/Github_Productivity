I don't see a development branch mentioned here https://oauthlib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributing.html or from the README.

The latest set of merged pull reqs were against `master`, eg: #69, #67, #66

The branches against this project are named `master`, `oauth2_provider`, `oauth2_draft25_server`, `use_request_objects`, it's not obvious which of these you're referring to.

@ib-lundgren @kennethreitz - I have considered contributing, but I think it'd be more like to be in the form of helping maintain a Django implementation, ideally also contributing compatible auth classes to django-rest-framework and django-tastypie to help converge the community on a single well documented and well maintained implementation.

I don't know whether that's pre-mature at the moment, and I'm a bit unsure what the current state of the project is...
- Should I consider OAuth1 useable yet?
- Will the OAuth2 server API be different or are all the differences implementation-only?
- Are there many/any well maintained implementations using this yet, or anyone else planning a Django implementation?
  I see https://github.com/craigbruce/django-oauth, but It's not clear how complete that currently is.

```

I think OAuth1 is usable and the next step really is to get some implementations going to weed out the remaining quirks and features needed.

OAuth2 is quite different from OAuth 1 in that it supports a great many more variations of obtaining tokens as well as types of tokens. I'm working quite actively on OAuth 2 provider support in the oauth2_provider branch but it needs a fair amount of work before it is complete.

I'm not sure whether you would want to mix OAuth 1 and 2 in the same extension or whether it makes more sense to split it into django-oauth and django-oauth2. It certainly is possible to mix them and differentiate between oauth 1 & 2 requests. Django more or less enforcing users to use their ORM makes creating a fully working drop-in oauth (1 or 2) provider extension possible. It could basically boil down to users simply decorating the views they want to protect and configure an authorization page.

```

```

I'm fairly oblivious to who are actually using OAuthLib and do not really know of any (first time i see the one you mention there). If you have time to do some research into whats available and contact those working on various implementations in order to join efforts that would be super awesome. I would love to collaborate more closely with people using OAuthLib, especially for the purpose of providing OAuth. \* note to self - encourage people to get in touch somewhere *.

Let me know if you'd like to have a chat over a G+ hangout to discuss this in more detail.

Cheers

If an extension seems daunting I have a little coffee stained post-it note with issues I mean to add this weekend of various sizes.
