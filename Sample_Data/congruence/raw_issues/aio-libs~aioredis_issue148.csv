> - Upgrade to latest hiredis including basic Windows support
> - Expose hiredis maxbuf settings in python
> ### 0.1.6
> - Updated with hiredis 0.12.1 â€”Â now only uses Redis parser, not entire library (30).

> ### 0.1.4
> - Allow any buffer compatible object as argument to feed (see 22).
> ### 0.1.3
> - Allow `protocolError` and `replyError` to be any type of callable (see 21).
