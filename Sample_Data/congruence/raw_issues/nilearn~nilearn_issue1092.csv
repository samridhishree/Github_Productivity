Recently I had to extract ""again"" from a 3d niimg multiple ROIs given by an atlas (3d niimg with multiple labels) and thought that NiftiLabelsMasker could do the job. But NiftiLabelsMasker gives its own summary statistic and I needed all the features to do my own statistic on them.

Do you think adding this feature to NiftiLabelsMasker would be useful to others, so it could also work like a NiftiAtlasMasker? it would be simple to implement and I can take care of it.

If so, it has already been suggested, a good interface has already been proposed but there was no consensus to integrate it.

The evoked option was to add an ""aggregator"" parameter that would be ""mean"" by default but could be replaced by any function. A bit like the ""scorer"" in scikit-learn. You would then be able to replace it with median, pca, or whatever you want.

Now the code is in the `img_to_signals_labels` function in `nilearn.regions.signal_extractor`. I didn't have time to do it yet.

If yes, this is also something that I am missing in the nilearn API right now. Even if it can easily be done with scipy, it might be a feature worthy of consideration.

Year, if you go region-by-region with one pass over your data using NiftiMasker, it will exactly give the regin-wise set of voxel-values. And then you can apply a custom pooling function on these selected features.
