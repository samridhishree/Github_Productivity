"issue_title","945","nilearn","nilearn","GaelVaroquaux","2016-01-13 17:57:40","We need a canonical brain mask. Maybe also one only of gray matter.

If they are very small, we should include them in the codebase (hence with a ""load_brain_mask"" function in datasets). If not, we need to create a ""fetch_brain_mask"" function in the downloaders.

If we choose to obtain it from the MNI template, eg doing:

<pre>
target_img = datasets.load_mni152_template()
grey_voxels = (target_img.get_data() > 0).astype(int)
mask_img = new_img_like(target_img, grey_voxels)
</pre>

we don't need to store anything addition. That might be the simplest / best solution.

It appeared as useful in an example downloading data from neurovault.

That's a good point.

Or

simply a canonical brain mask as done in PR #1103

How does it go with grey matter mask ? We simply compute it from ICBM ['gm'] and resample to MNI template and return it, [like here!](https://github.com/NeuroVault/neurovault_analysis/blob/master/compute_gm_mask.py)
