Newer pyobject uses some local class FunctionInfo to export functions, and the pygi brain module doesn't handle it. So there's tons of no-member warnings

This patch alters the inspection to fallback to assuming anything 'callable' is a function, and everything left over is a constant. The latter bit fixes some issues I see using Gdk constants

Hi,

could you please submit this as a pull request on the pylint-brain project ? (https://bitbucket.org/logilab/pylint-brain/) 

Also, you may be interested in https://bitbucket.org/logilab/pylint-brain/issue/4/py2gi-rewrite-using-the-living-object if you have some time to spend on this :)

Okay, should the pull request be against astroid or brain? honestly the split confuses me at this point (this is where something like a git submodule would help...)

this should go to pylint-brain, as everything under astroid/brain. While it
would be nice, Unfortunatly I don't think bitbucket support subrepos.
