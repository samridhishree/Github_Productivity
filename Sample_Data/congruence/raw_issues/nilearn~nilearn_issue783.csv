No. Do you have a self-contained example that reproduces the problem on your machine ?

I guess you can use an absolute path in your case. Not sure what best practices are, people who use joblib more than me can comment if they wish.

The output in spyder

and when I run it outside spyder

``` python

spyder created nilearn_cache in the same folder where the code is located.
