Hi,

I have same code in two files in a project, and this is by design, since these are test cases. On running pylint on my project I am being thrown a `duplicate-code` warning by pylint even though I have disabled the pylint check for duplicate-code in both of my files locally `# pylint: disable=duplicate-code` .
I can suppress this warning globally by running `pylint <foldername> --disable=duplicate-code` which I don't want because I really don't want duplicate-code to exist in the project; they can only exist if the user has any specific requirements.

regards
Rohit

This has nothing to do with astroid and is a duplicate of [#214 in pylint](https://bitbucket.org/logilab/pylint/issues/214/the-duplicate-code-r0801-cant-be-disabled) to which Claudiu and I already linked you to via IRC and mailinglist...

Thanks, Florian.

I have two test classes (in two files) that are almost identical in one place, but this is by design; as usual this with tests, I suppose. How can I disable the `duplicate-code` warning locally?

The issue linked to Bitbucket above is not accessible anymore. -- Please advise.
