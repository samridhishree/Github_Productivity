First of all, I'm definitely not very acquainted with OAuth, so this question might seem stupid. I'm porting an application from oauth to oauthlib and I noticed that in oauth I have this string in the Authorization header `realm=""""`. I can't replicate this with oauthlib, by passing realm="""" in the constructor, since doing this check here https://github.com/idan/oauthlib/blob/master/oauthlib/oauth1/rfc5849/parameters.py#L77 ignores any empty strings. Wouldn't it have been better to use `if realm is not None`? Now I don't know if an empty realm makes sense or not.

Thank you.

"issue_comment","330","idan","oauthlib","foxx","2015-07-01 20:27:49","RFC5849 doesn't specify whether realm can be an empty string or not. However, this would be a backwards incompatible change, as some people may be relying on the opposite behaviour. I've had a look at some other libraries, and they seem to implement it the same way `oauthlib` has.

If you can find any evidence that other libraries handle this differently, please let me know. Otherwise, one option is for us to add a flag, disabled by default, which changes the behaviour. This does add slightly more code complexity, would need to see a +1 from another contributor for this.
