`socket.gaierror: [Errno -2] Name or service not known` is not very handy, adding host/port pair to error message (like https://github.com/KeepSafe/aiohttp/blob/master/aiohttp/connector.py#L295-L299) would be useful.

But it is still straight forward meaning there's a problem with target host.

Anyway, I will take a look at it.

Showing failed address may point him on, say, bad config record and so on.

I didn't want to catch a single `OSError` cause there also may be some other errors (like `AssertionError` from `create_connection`) and catching wildcard errors just to log address seems to be a bad style for me.
