- [x] The utils module should be split in:
  - A _utils (or utils) directory containing stuff only for our internal use: utils/conversions for _asarray and utils/cache_mixin for the CacheMixin, and probably the testing 
  - A niimg_utils file containing all the concat_niims and check_niimgs related code
  - largest_connected_component: where does this go? I see it used only in masking, so I am wondering whether it should not be there
- [x] Consolidate the image part and the resampling part. We need an 'image' directory, in which we put image and resampling.
- [x] Rename io in input_data
- [x] Similarly, I feel that the NiftiLabelsMasker and NiftiMapsMasker are a bit 'far'. It seems to me that they belong to the same kind of code, and should fit close to eachother.

I meant far to NiftiMasker

I suggest niimg-like. Just like there is 'array-like' in numpy.

> I think we should move the largest component into the image part.

I agree.

> What about doing a little meeting with UMLish drawings ? ;)

Yeah, right.
