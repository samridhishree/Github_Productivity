"issue_comment","1429","nilearn","nilearn","KamalakerDadi","2017-04-05 13:37:13","In ```doc/building_blocks/manual_pipeline.rst```, we should change name ```dataset``` to ```haxby_dataset``` to be in consistent with the example ```examples/plot_decoding_tutorial.py``` we are pointing to. Sample code is a bit of mix of both names dataset and haxby_dataset.

Also, section ""6.1.1.3. Masking the data: from 4D image to 2D array"" should be moved to above ""6.1.1.2. Loading non image data: experiment description"". The reason is in between we have conditioning applied to the masked dataset (fmri_masked) restricting to face vs cat labels which is done before masking. This might confuse users if they have followed the code snippets. 

Any thoughts on this ? ping @GaelVaroquaux @bthirion ","",""
