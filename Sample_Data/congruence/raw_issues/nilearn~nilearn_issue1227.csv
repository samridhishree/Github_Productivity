I don't mind having to force people to type ""subject=range(5)"" because
it's the kind of things that is not typed by deginers: beginers only
download one subject for example.

But, I don't think that I want to break backward compatibility, so we
should keep as a temporary solution n_subjects.

>   • Idea 2: mixed api with n_subjects and subjects, defaulting to 1 and [2]. I don't like it because in many cases one argument would have to override the other and the user has to figure out the logic.

Interesting. What is it? The position of the cut_coords should be
changed?

I'd like all to run on the 2nd subject, that way we avoid downloading
other ones on the doc-building server and during the tutorials.

With regards to the examples, maybe some still need to be updated.

In particular in https://1990-1235740-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0//home/ubuntu/nilearn/doc/_build/html/auto_examples/02_decoding/plot_haxby_searchlight.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-02-decoding-plot-haxby-searchlight-py
I think that you need to change the cut coordinate, to cut in a place where it makes more sense. It might be that cutting at z=-5 is the right option: https://1990-1235740-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0//home/ubuntu/nilearn/doc/_build/html/auto_examples/02_decoding/plot_haxby_space_net.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-02-decoding-plot-haxby-space-net-py

Hum. But we can't do that: it increases our download, which is a major
problem on the continuous integration.

Yes, plot_haxby_space_net looks good.

For plot_haxby_searchlight, the problem is that we use a ""process_mask"",
which is hand-tuned on the ""right"" region. That region has changed when
we changed subject. I've played with the example, and I am sending you a
PR with changes to it.
