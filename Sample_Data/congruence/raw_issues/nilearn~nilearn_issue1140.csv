It might make the examples more readable and also give to the users more chances of being able to load new data (ie other than what's in the Haxby example).

Example with the code taken from [examples/02_decoding/plot_haxby_anova_svm.py](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/examples/02_decoding/plot_haxby_anova_svm.py):
- This the current version:

``` python
# Load the behavioral data
import numpy as np
y, session = np.loadtxt(haxby_dataset.session_target[0]).astype(""int"").T
conditions = np.recfromtxt(haxby_dataset.conditions_target[0])['f0']
```
- Here is the `pandas` version:

``` python
# Load the behavioral data
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv(haxby_dataset.session_target[0], header=None,
                 names=['y', 'session'], delimiter=' ')
y = df.y.values
session = df.session.values
df = pd.read_csv(haxby_dataset.conditions_target[0], header=None,
                 names=['f0', 'f1'], delimiter=' ')
conditions = df.f0.values.astype('S12')
```

But maybe this is not the best example or I don't have a good usage of pandas.

Out of interest, would that be only for the examples for now, i.e. we wouldn't add it as a dependency of nilearn?
