The pygi plugin fails to detect glib with pygobject3-3.13.91. Example:

$ cat test.py

```
#!python

from gi.repository import GLib
from gi.repository import GObject

# These exist
print GLib.idle_add
print GObject.threads_init

# These don't exist
print GLib.foobarbaz
print GObject.bazbarfoo
```

$ pylint test.py --rcfile src/virt-manager/tests/pylint.cfg

```
#!bash

************* Module test
E:  1, 0: No name 'GLib' in module 'gi.repository' (no-name-in-module)
E: 10, 6: Module 'gi.repository.GObject' has no 'bazbarfoo' member (no-member)
```

I'll submit a patch shortly
