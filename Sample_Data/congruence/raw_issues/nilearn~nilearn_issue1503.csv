You can try this :

```python
import numpy as np
from nilearn.datasets import fetch_atlas_aal
from nilearn.plotting import find_xyz_cut_coords
import nibabel as nib

# fetch atlas and get image data
aal = fetch_atlas_aal()
aal_img = nib.load(aal['maps'])
aal_data = aal_img.get_data()

aal_coords = []
# iterate over all rois
for index in aal['indices']:
    # set the current roi to 1
    roi_data = np.array(aal_data)
    roi_data[roi_data != int(index)] = 0
    roi_data[roi_data == int(index)] = 1
    # create an image for the current roi
    roi_img = nib.Nifti1Image(dataobj=roi_data, affine=aal_img.affine)
    # extract roi center of mass
    aal_coords.append(find_xyz_cut_coords(roi_img))

how to do it. Or You can use this code from PR #664 at the moment.

But, soon we would like to merge that PR in Nilearn.","",""

I copied the code in my worksheet in python but when I tried using it it
didn't work

the code I copied is this:

    label_affine = label_img.get_affine()

    # grab number of unique values in 3d image
    label_unique = np.unique(label_data)[1:]

    # grab center of mass from parcellations and dump into coords list
    coord_list = []
    for i, cur_label in enumerate(label_unique):
        cur_img = label_data == cur_label

        #take the largest connected component
        volume = np.asarray(cur_img)
