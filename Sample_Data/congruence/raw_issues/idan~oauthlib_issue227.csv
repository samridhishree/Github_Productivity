"issue_comment","227","idan","oauthlib","ib-lundgren","2014-05-27 13:12:58","There is one old and annoyingly vague error that keeps causing confusion that I'll aim to address the coming week in https://github.com/idan/oauthlib/blob/master/oauthlib/common.py#L136

If the OAuth 2 ones are good then that is great, added this issue as a note to self to look it over since most were created quite quickly.
