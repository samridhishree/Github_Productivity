For Python 3, the following code will trigger a crash in astroid:

```
#!python

with open('c.txt', 'w') as stream, open('b.txt', 'w'):
    stream.write('a')

```

The traceback is:
  File ""D:\Python33\lib\site-packages\pylint-1.1.0-py3.3.egg\pylint\checkers\base.py"", line 349, in visit_callfunc
    infered = next(node.func.infer())

AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'infer'

The problem is in astroid.protocols.with_assignment_statements, where `vars` can be None in the case of the second context manager, which doesn't use the `as` assignment.

Don't crash when inferring nodes from with statements, with multiple context managers. Closes #18.
