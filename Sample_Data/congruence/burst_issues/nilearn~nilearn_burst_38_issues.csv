Could it be something related to the fact that a t-test is signed and not
an F-test. For instance in a max-stats correction procedure, the max
should be taken on the abs of the statistic. Also, when thresholding, the
threshold is applied on the abs of the statistic.

OK, let's go with merging this guy, but this is really not how we work.
We need to be always example driven in order to make the right choices
for the APIs. Here, it is especially important, as there is no equivalent

need to know how to organize it.

I think that in the long run, we should be using more and more pandas datasframes in the example code and for behavioral variables. Indeed, when they are well used, they make the code more readable. Thus to foster adoption this could be something important.

Right now, pandas is a package that has enough adoption and install basis that I feel it is safe to depend on it. Nonetheless we could delay the import to inside the function, so that if pandas is not installed, the whole import of nilearn does not fail.

For simple things it is easier. Also, I mention this to replace a

If recarrays are tricky, then pandas dataframe are intricate. For example, a simple join makes the index column disappear and one has to call `reset_index` to get it back. I am not against using DataFrame in our functions but I think we should always expose recarrays to the user.
