I ran into a couple of test failures:

LoadModuleFromPathTest was failing on the 2nd pass because sys.just_once had been deleted.

In AstroidManagerTest there may be other hooks already present, so deleting 0 isn't correct. Removing -1 would likely work, but we may as well just look up the index and use that.

Weird, nothing fails for me or in the CI. Could you send this as a PR? Thanks!

In openstack.org's neutron project, using pylint 1.4.4, when astroid updated to 1.4.1 pylint failed with many non-sensical errors. For example, use of any module from an import was showing a undefined variable error in pylint, which worked fine with astroid 1.3.8 and pylint 1.4.4. We see the same issue with astroid 1.4.0 as well.

E.g.

import abc
import six
...
@six.add_metaclass(abc.ABCMeta)

Plyint would report undefined variable for 'abc' and 'six'. This happens for every import in every file.

I can confirm the above. Had to pin astroid version to 1.3.8 to get pylint 1.4.4 to keep working. Works for now, would be nice if the issue gets resolved however.

Here is a stacktrace.

I'm pretty sure mixing a new astroid version with an old pylint version is an unsupported thing and expected to break.

Yes, they are pretty much incompatible, so try to update pylint to 1.5.0. I know this would have been been better if they we're called 2.0.

Should there be some constraint that prevents pylint 1.4.4 from using astroid 1.4.x? Currently, several projects in OpenStack are using pylint 1.4.4, which is pulling in astroid 1.4.1 as a dependency and breaking.

It probably should, but I don't know if it's possible to release 1.4.5 with a pinned dependency of astroid if there is a newer release on PyPi. This is a genuine question, I don't know if it works to upload an older bug fix release.

I don't see why not - there are projects which have several maintained major versions after all, right?

I'm going to give it a try then. Paul, would 1.4.5 with a pinned dependency of astroid help you at all?

Yes, I think it would, as currently, we are pinning pylint to 1.4.4, and it is pulling in astroid 1.4.1. We could pin pylint to 1.4.5 and it may ease the pain.

---

Yes, appropriate deps within the 1.4.x series would make it a lot easier: rather than trying to coordinate changes to astroid across dozens of projects that all will move to pylint 1.5 at some future point, we can just specify pylint 1.4.5 as compatible with 1.4.4 and let astroid be managed by the pylint dependency.

astroid<1.4.0 would be the preferred way to spell it IMO, then if you do decide to do a point release of astroid you have space to do it in.

Hey folks, sorry for the delay. pylint 1.4.5 hit PyPi, please test and tell me if something is not working as expected. Except the astroid change, everything is the same as in 1.4.4.
