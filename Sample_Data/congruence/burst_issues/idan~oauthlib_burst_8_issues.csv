I'm very intrigued as to how you are finding the provider, any suggestions for changes? I have personally not have that much time to play around with actually using it in a project apart from my first stab at it with https://github.com/ib-lundgren/flask-oauthprovider

Good that you pointed out the issue of access to params, I have a vague memory of running into the same. To make your life a little easier I've now updated verify to return a request object filled with most arguments you might be interested in (signature, client_key, resource_owner_key, nonce, timestamp,callback_uri, verifier, signature_method, realm). I've not pushed to pypi, only github atm.

before: authorized = server.verify(...)
now: authorized, request = server.verify(...)

Please let me know if there is anything else that would be good or problems you are running into. If I can't solve them in code I'll try and add to the docs. Oh and I will definitely have a look at your implementation at some point =)

Our tests however do naive string comparisons which is not adequate and breaks in python 3.3. There might already be a function such as assertURLEquals but I've not looked into this. If not it is worth monkey patching this onto TestCase and using it.  It should be quite straightforward using urlsparse and just making sure all query and fragment pairs are present in both strings.

OAuthLib aims to be very strictly spec compliant\* and while sorting the parameters seem rather innocent it's not the expected behaviour. Furthermore I much rather improve the tests and make them robust than tweak the code to fit the tests. Adding an assert_url_equals method to TestCase is rather trivial (using urlparse for the heavy lifting). 

For the two tuples I think TestCase.assertItemsEqual should be sufficient.

Thanks so much!  I was almost literally just getting back to this after UDS-R
and post-Copenhagen travel.  You probably beat me by just a couple of hours. :)

Fantastic, thanks.  I'll test the PyPI version.  If it looks good, I'll go
ahead and upload to Ubuntu 13.04, otherwise will file bugs if I find any other
problems.

Indeed!  We've upgraded urllib3 and requests in 13.04 to the latest PyPI
versions.  One change we're making in the packaging though, is to use
chardet2, urllib3, and oauthlib from the Debian packages instead of the
bundled versions in requests (I wonder why they do that :/).

It all needs a bit of testing, but after I get everything uploaded properly,
I'll start converting some of the dependent packages, and continue testing.

7,issue_comment,62,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2012-11-08 21:10:07,"The reason requests vendors OAuthLib is because we are still in a flux with quite frequent changes. @kennethreitz is a very responsive and friendly guy so if the vendoring is a concern just ping him.

Although we are unlikely to break anything related to OAuth 1 clients most of the OAuth 2 API will likely undergo quite a bit of changes. One day (probably quite a few months from now) I envision hitting 1.0 at which point the API will be stable. 

Feel free to send bugs, PRs and just about anything our way and we'll take a look at it =)
