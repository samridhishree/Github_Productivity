No. I trusted Giorgio's bench. But in the circleCI build it didn't make
any difference :(.

I think that we should still merge, as the code will be faster in certain
situations and it's rather more clean.

The test that I had written had a stupid loop, by the way. I fixed it.

I tried, but without a big subject-level data (eg HCP), the cost of the
SVDs is lost in things like filtering, smoothing, and the multiple ICAs.
:(

I added a docstring. But this is supposed to be a private function, hence
we don't want it in the narrative documentation.
