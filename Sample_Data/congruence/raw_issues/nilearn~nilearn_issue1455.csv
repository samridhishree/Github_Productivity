You probably wish to loop over ROIs.

I tried the code of @mrahim and it worked perfectely.

but when I tried plotting the connectome of my correlation matrix I got this error:
ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

In the code after computing the correlation matrix I called:
G=nx.from_numpy_matrix(correlation_matrix)
to create a graph from the matrix
and then I called:
correlation_matrix=nx.to_numpy_matrix(G)
to recreate the matrix from the graph
I suppose that something has gone wrong in between.

Now it works thank you.","",""
