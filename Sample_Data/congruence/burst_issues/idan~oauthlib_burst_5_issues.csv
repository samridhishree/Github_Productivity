0,issue_title,21,idan,oauthlib,calebbrown,2012-04-19 04:14:37,"### Problem

The problem I was having was that `oauth1.rfc5849.signature.collect_parameters()` was not properly supporting headers that were in unicode.

This problem doesn't expose itself unless you pass through parameters that will change when escaped/unescaped, e.g URLs.

The problem can be seen in `Client.sign()`. What happens is `oauth1.rfc5849.parameters.prepare_headers()` is called (via `Client._contribute_parameters()`), builds _and_ escapes the headers and returns a unicode encoded header string.

This is then passed to `signature.collect_parameters()` (via `Client.get_oauth_signature()`) which fails to unescape the headers because they're in unicode.

The base string is then built from these, leading to an incorrect signature being generated.
### Solution

My implementation solves the problem by allowing both unicode and str types to be unescaped in `signature.collect_parameters()`.

The fix is in the last two changesets.

This pull requests also includes everything from my [last pull request](https://github.com/idangazit/oauthlib/pull/20) (if I had planned it better they would've all been in separate branches :/)

OAuthLib is unicode everwhere, in unicode, out unicode. The spec mentions character codes in ASCII but if you convert unicode to ascii you will see that they are not violated. ie 34 == ord(u'""'.encode(""ascii""))

Added support for only including the body in the signature's base string when the Content-Type is set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded. This brings it inline with the RFC and stops multipart requests failing.

It is true that when contributing parameters from the request body there is only one allowed content type, application/x-www-form-urlencoded (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.4.1.3.1), which must be present in the content-type request header. It is safe to assume this will be the default value, please update content_type to be an optional argument of collect_parameters with default value u'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'.

Removed the invalid 'safe' parameter from urllib.unquote()

~ really is a safe character http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.6 #2

Ah, I probably should've clarified that before I made the change. Part of the problem was that `utils.unescape()` was only accepting non-unicode strings, and `signature.collect_parameters()` would only unescape strings that weren't unicode. Which means a header passed to it as a unicode string wouldn't be handled correctly.

If you're happy, I can revert that changeset and remove the restrictions on `utils.unescape()` to allow both unicode and str types and fix `signature.collect_paramters()` so that it will call `unescape()` for both types of string.

It is safe to assume this will be the default value, please update content_type to be an optional argument of collect_parameters with default value u'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'.

Yep I can make that change. If I do that should I also add content_type as an argument to the methods that call `collect_parameters()` so the code underneath can pass that through?

At the moment it is extracting it from the request headers and will default to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` if it isn't set.

Yep, I didn't remove it because it wasn't 'safe', but because [urllib.unquote](http://docs.python.org/library/urllib.html#urllib.unquote) doesn't have 'safe' as an argument. Also `urllib.unquote('~') == '~'` which means it works correctly.

Yes, that's better. What do you think @dgouldin @idangazit?

Good idea but might be worth its own pull request.

Fair enough =) Interestingly the Python docs only mention '_.-' to be safe by default http://docs.python.org/library/urllib.html#urllib.quote. Might be a good idea to add a comment mentioning this.

Ah alright, looks good.
