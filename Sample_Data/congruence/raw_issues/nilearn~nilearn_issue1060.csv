I am afraid that the problem is caused by conflicting presence of Python 3 and Python 2. This issue disappeared as I uninstall everything and currently it works with Anaconda Python 3.5.1 :: Anaconda 2.5.0 (64-bit).

Look at https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/ for more details.
