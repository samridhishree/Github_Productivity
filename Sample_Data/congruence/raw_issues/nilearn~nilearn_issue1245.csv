Just to check that I understand things right: this happens when the peak

Maybe the special case should be done in the RegionExtractor, and not the
random walker? It would seem more consistent with the API of these
objects.

Also, in the logic of the function of RegionExtractor, I don't fully
understand why it's a problem that one of the maps gives rise to no
regions.

In large data setting, this might not be the case.

No, not in random walker.

Giving rise to no regions will not be a problem. It would concatenate the image no matter it has regions in it or not.

But concatenation fails when there are no images at all, empty list is provided. This empty list is been generated by the fact that given components image has no information at all (lets say empty) though it seems like components in it. This is what I am experiencing now when trying to test my pipeline on small usecase (n_subjects=1).

This issue is a very rare case just want to fix it with meaningful error message or warnings returned with empty list as it is.
