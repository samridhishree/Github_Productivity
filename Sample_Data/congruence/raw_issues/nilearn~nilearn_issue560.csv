This does freeze my computer (16GB memory) when trying to apply transform() on the full 4d image, yet does not when transforming individual 3d images of the 4d nifti image successively. Mask and 4d nifti are in the same space (i.e., no resampling). Sorry for the anecdotal evidence.

Might there be a memory issue in NiftiMasker.transform()?
