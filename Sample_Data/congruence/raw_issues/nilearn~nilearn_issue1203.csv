ROI details are stored in an xslx file in the original archive. We cannot load them without adding a dependency. To solve that, I added a CSV file directly in nilearn, similarly to what we did for dosenbach atlas. This has two pros: We can still rely on the original website for download (which is good in term of licensing) and we can load the coordinates of the ROIs for free (no download requires).

Description is on the way, I put the code here for review.
