Unfortunately, this takes a lot of disk space under nifti format because data is not masked and I don't want to gzip it because it is time consuming. The best way to save it is under the .npy form, along with the corresponding mask (ideally, a path to the mask). This way, check_niimg could unmask my images on the fly.

I'd rather not. This is an internal format that we don't want to expose
to users. I'd rather rely on joblib and the shelve mechanism for this
purpose. Which also means that none of this is exposed to the end user.

representations: some that make sens from a neuroscientific point of
view, and these should absolutely be stored as nifti images, and some
that are mere convenience for speed/caching reasons, and those should be
easily recomputable from neuroscientific data, and thus rely on joblib.
My analysis may be wrong, but I'll need a more precise usecase to be
convinced.

If I understand well, @AlexandreAbraham not only runs a given processing many times on the same set of masked images (which joblib is good for), but also runs several different processing on the same images. In the latter case, joblib is kind of awkward to use, even with the (still in progress) references. While I agree that providing a tuple as a niimg is not a good idea, using joblib for this is not (right now) a handy solution either.

- [x] The utils module should be split in:
  - A _utils (or utils) directory containing stuff only for our internal use: utils/conversions for _asarray and utils/cache_mixin for the CacheMixin, and probably the testing 
  - A niimg_utils file containing all the concat_niims and check_niimgs related code
  - largest_connected_component: where does this go? I see it used only in masking, so I am wondering whether it should not be there
- [x] Consolidate the image part and the resampling part. We need an 'image' directory, in which we put image and resampling.
- [x] Rename io in input_data
- [x] Similarly, I feel that the NiftiLabelsMasker and NiftiMapsMasker are a bit 'far'. It seems to me that they belong to the same kind of code, and should fit close to eachother.

I suggest niimg-like. Just like there is 'array-like' in numpy.

I agree.

Yeah, right.
