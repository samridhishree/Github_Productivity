"issue_comment","1392","nilearn","nilearn","AlexandreAbraham","2017-02-28 15:45:21","It is wrong because you fix a missing file by not deleting it whereas deleting is an explicit functionality of this method. One option is to roll back the changes that introduced the bug or, given that file deletion is now in the zip case, you could just exit the function at the end of this code block. But it is not possible to let gargabe files all around the users hard drive.","",""
