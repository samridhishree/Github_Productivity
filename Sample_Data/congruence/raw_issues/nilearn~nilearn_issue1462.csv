As issue pointed may be you have forgotten to add ```figure``` also where it would be nice for users also to pass fig=plt.figure():

>We should strive to make the plot_surf function as homogeneous as possible with the other plotting functions, and thus add both an ""axes"" and a ""figure"" argument, with the same semantics.
