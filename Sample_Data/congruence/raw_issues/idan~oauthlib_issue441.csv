Now, in method _handler_for_request() called by validate_authorization_request() there's a call to if ""openid"" in request.scopes, which expects of course request.scopes to be an Iterable.

Since I couldn't find any other way this library to work, please merge it so that it's available to be installed via pip.
Thanks!

"issue_comment","441","idan","oauthlib","Sumukh","2016-10-20 19:11:18","#436 is also another approach to this same issue. In the meantime, what we have done is install directly from our fork. 

I have a fork that should work:  https://github.com/Sumukh/oauthlib
