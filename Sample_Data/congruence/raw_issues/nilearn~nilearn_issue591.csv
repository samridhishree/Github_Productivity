I was having an issue installing nilearn (potentially related to my python or OS version?). When initially trying to install nilearn with pip, I got the following output (with a few warnings)...

```
MNI-Space:Desktop jamielarshanson$ sudo pip install -U --user nilearn

I re-ran with sudo with a -H flag and got the following output (again some warnings)...

I wasn't sure how important the SSL warnings were? 
Next, when I try to import nilearn in ipython, it isn't found....

```

I'm rather new to python and wasn't sure how to troubleshoot. I had nilearn working previously, but that was a few months ago. Any thoughts are greatly appreciated!

This is a pip related problem because root doesn't own the current directory. Doing `cd /tmp && sudo pip install -U --user nilearn` fixes the problem.

> I re-ran with sudo with a -H flag and got the following output (again some warnings)...

Obviously it works because `-H` changes your `$HOME` variable and thus pip ends up installing in root's home, which is owned by root. Note that updating pip should also fix the issue.

> I wasn't sure how important the SSL warnings were? 

Not important when it comes to downloading software.

Seems like a configuration problem to me.
Can you try:
- `import nibabel`
- `import sys; print sys.path`
- `which pip` (in the terminal, not in ipython)

I can import nibabel, but am still having trouble with nilearn (various output below). Further thoughts?
