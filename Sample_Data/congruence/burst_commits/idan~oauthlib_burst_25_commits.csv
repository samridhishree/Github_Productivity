In order to support adding custom signature methods, the current signature methods -- HMAC-SHA1, RSA-SHA1, and PLAINTEXT -- need to be implemented with a common interface. In a previous attempt, I tried changing those functions directly, but there are too many dependencies on their current signatures. By shimming them instead with these thin wrappers, I can provide the common interface I need without breaking everything else in the library.",ea106971af90556e5c682e0a367314111f7f0162,,"api.github.com,git_clone","[u'[""tests/oauth1/rfc5849/test_signatures.py"", ""oauthlib/oauth1/rfc5849/signature.py""]']",False,[],[],[],[],2014-03-25
