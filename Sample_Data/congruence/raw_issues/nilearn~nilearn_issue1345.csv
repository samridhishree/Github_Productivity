I would like to align two MNI space images(same resolution, different affine&shape) to the same voxel space.

>image.resample_to_img(atlas,stats, 
                    interpolation='nearest', copy=True, order='F')

and raise an errorï¼š

>BoundingBoxError: The field of view given by the target affine does not contain any of the data

So can you tell me how to do this?

Can you check by specifying coordinates to [0, 0, 0]. If image is in MNI space then you see cursor at AC-PC line (Please google it if you don't know what AC-PC is)

Let me know after aligning to MNI space, if it worked or not ?","",""
