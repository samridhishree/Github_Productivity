To do:
- [x] Implement an API for downloading selected images from http://neurovault.org/
- [x] Create dataset documentation
- [x] Create a basic example for downloading a subset of files.
- [x] Create a more complex ICA-based example.
- [x] Create tests
- [x] Remove dependency on `requests` - use `urllib`
- [x] Read from disk when offline.
- [ ] Detect outdated cached collection or image metadata or data.

Neurovault contains images in collections. Collections can be filtered via a few querystring arguments. Images to download and return should be limited by filters on collection and image metadata.

To do this, I've included `collection_filters` and `image_filters` arguments.
- If `isinstance(collection_filters, dict)`, the filters are used as querystring argument filters.
- If `isinstance(*_filters, collections.Iterable)` (i.e. a list), the filters are assumed to be functions that receive a collection or image metadata, and returns `True` if the collection's images should be queried, or if the image should be downloaded.

The function returns a `Bunch` of three:
- `collections`: a dict (key: collection_id) of collection metadata for matched collections.
- `images`: a list of image metadata (including local file paths) for matched & downloaded images.
- `func_files`: a list of paths to downloaded files. Could be removed, but I kept it as many other functions return a list of paths to images.

The example I've begun with is a `stop-go` task meta-analysis, ported from:
https://github.com/NeuroVault/neurovault_analysis/blob/master/Stop%20vs.%20Go%20metaanalysis.ipynb

Note that I avoided trying to convert things to a `pandas` dataframe. The previous examples downloaded all images and filtered using `pandas`; however, all `nilearn` dataset fetchers filter before returning to the user. It was simple enough to allow lambda functions as filters to make very powerful pre-fetch filtering available to the user, so I went that route.

Looking for feedback on the overall API design to start. @chrisfilo and anyone else around!

I think that the macanism of filters is too complicated for most of our users. We can keep it for advanced users but at some point we should provide simpler pre-made filters. For example, I think that a user should be able to specify the id of a collection or a list of ids (I know that it's possible through collection_filter). But we'll see that later.

> The example I've begun with is a stop-go task meta-analysis

Reproducing an example provided by neurovault is indeed the way to go.

So far, we have avoided this dependency but we may have to include it at some point. Is there a real benefit to use pandas here?

The PR so far looks like really good work to me ;).

Regardless of online or offline, there is an updating problem. When online, the code assumes that a cached copy of a particular collection or image metadata, or image data is correct / up-to-date. I have the `refresh` flag for controlling that behavior. A more automated mechanism is possible.

Separate from that, the code needs to work in offline mode; currently it does not. I have added that to the WIP item list.

Right; glad to add more simple filters. It's very easy to map from the simple filters to the more complex ones. The complex filters were needed to mirror the logic of the example I ported, but I could also change it to use specific collections and images (and tell users they were determined by searches on the website).

> So far, we have avoided this dependency but we may have to include it at some point. Is there a real benefit to use pandas here?

In the previous examples, the benefit was using Pandas' filtering mechanisms, which tend to lead to simpler code. But I just don't see it as an option here, unless we limit users to very simple filters (which I think would be a shame).
