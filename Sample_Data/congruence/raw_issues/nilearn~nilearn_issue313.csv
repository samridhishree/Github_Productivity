Personally I find it quite nice to have the main plotting function variations in the same file, rather than having to look through a few files to find the one you are after.

OK, but we should have at least one very simple example that generates
the figure on the first page of the project. That way people don't get
frightened.

Maybe break down examples in the simplest then. I'd probably go for breakdown by function (plot_stat_map, plot_glass_brain, plot_roi, plot_epi, ...) + one for more advanced stuff where you get a display object and use add_overlay, add_contours, add_edges on it.
