For this reason, [some popular Redis libraries support SSL connections](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py/blob/1c2071762ad9b9288e786665990083e61c1cf355/redis/connection.py#L656).

This change adds support for SSL/TLS by leveraging asyncio's existing SSL support in [asyncio.BaseEventLoop.create_connection](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.BaseEventLoop.create_connection) and using its semantics.

I didn't exhaustively research or test this change, so this pull request is simply my first pass at how such a change might look. I welcome critical feedback on it.

Thanks for this library!

Regarding testing, I've only been using the `ssl=True` scenario (which uses defaults and works with a trusted certificate authority issued certificate)

It looks like when @oranagra of RedisLabs [added SSL support to redis-py](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py/pull/446#issuecomment-42936052), he just noted that it worked with an SSL server.

One option is to create a self-signed certificate and then use `stunnel` locally. Perhaps with this setup, one could manually create the [ssl.SSLContext](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#ssl.SSLContext) and trust the generated certificate.

Any guidance on where I should go from here? I didn't know if you'd want to add something like stunnel to your testing environment.

Thanks again for your consideration of this PR!

P.S. [Redislabs blog post](https://redislabs.com/blog/secure-redis-ssl-added-to-redsmin-and-clients) when SSL was added to some popular clients.
