But I don' t think that the speed up will be significant.

"issue_comment","414","nilearn","nilearn","eickenberg","2015-02-06 13:23:37","Gladly, but I cannot go lower than 7 on axes x and y because of the axis slicer who seems to expect at least this. So now I am running all the previous tests for positive, negative and mixed data, that means I am doing 3 \* 10 = 30 plots. In total this takes around 55 seconds.

The only way to reduce this significantly is by doing less test cases, not by reducing the image size - we are almost in pure plotting overhead here. I could do positive/negative/mixed only for plot_stat_map for instance.
